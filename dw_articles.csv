At least 54 people had been killed in a period of 24 hours on Thursday – a figure which, according to local media, had increased to least 63 by Friday.

Almost 200 deaths have been reportednationwide since June 26. On Thursday, authorities imposed a so-called section 144 warning which bans bathing, swimming or boating in rivers, canals, ponds, lakes, reservoirs or any other open spaces where rainwater may have accumulated. Television news footage showed an army helicopter plucking three members of a family from the roof of their house after they were stranded by a flash flood on the outskirts of Rawalpindi, which neighbors the capital city of Islamabad on the Sawan river. Tourists were advised to avoid travel to affected areas where rains could trigger landslides and block highways. On Friday, the PDMA reported ""medium-level"" flooding in the town of Kalabagh on the Indus river and ""low-level"" flooding in four other locations. ""The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and glacial melting,"" said a PDMA spokesperson in a statement. Pakistan's second-largest city, Lahore, received ""light to moderate"" rain on Friday, according to the local Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA). Meanwhile, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted several more spells of heavy rain in the coming weeks, starting with a seven-day period next week and continuing with further spells into late August. In 2022, extreme rain and flooding inundated a third of the country, killing over 1,700 people. Authorities have warned they cannot rule out a repeat. Edited by: Rana Taha"
Brazil's Bolsonaro ordered to wear ankle monitor,https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-s-bolsonaro-ordered-to-wear-ankle-monitor/a-73327772?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T13:58:00Z,"Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former PresidentJair Bolsonaroto wear an ankle monitor. The decision came as authorities searched the former president's home and party headquarters in Brasília on Friday. He was additionally ordered to stop using social media and to cease communications with diplomats. The former president is also banned from contacting others under investigation, including his son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian lawmaker living in the US with close ties to PresidentDonald Trump. The measures are reportedly aimed at preventing Bolsonaro from fleeing to the US, where Trump has threatened steep tariffs on Brazilian imports in an effort to ease legal pressure on the former president. Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedlyplotting to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, said he never considered fleeing the country and called the court's measure his ""supreme humiliation."" Trump, who maintained a friendly relationship with Bolsonaro while both were in office, has repeatedly claimed the former Brazilian president is the victim of a ""witch hunt."" ""I have seen the terrible treatment you are receiving at the hands of an unjust system turned against you,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Bolsonaro that he posted on social media Thursday night, before the raids and court order. Trump also said hisproposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian importswere intended to pressure Brazilian authorities into dropping the charges. Unlike Trump’s other tariffs, including those imposed on US allies, the ones targeting Brazil, set to take effect in August, were announced in openly political terms. At the time, he said they were a response to ""Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections."" Brazilian PresidentLuiz Inacio Lula da Silvacalled the threatened duty""unacceptable blackmail."" The Supreme Court’s restrictions on Bolsonaro also stem from a second investigation into his son Eduardo, who is accused of collaborating with US authorities to sanction Brazilian officials. On Wednesday, Eduardo posted a video filmed outside the White House, saying he had just concluded a round of meetings with US officials. He had reportedly urged senior White House officials to impose sanctions on the Brazilian judge overseeing his father’s prosecution. Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the trial now in its final stages, said the president and his son Eduardo had incited ""hostile acts"" against Brazil. He said Bolsonaro had asked the ""head of state of a foreign nation"" to interfere in the Brazilian courts.

Fact check: Misinformation fuels anti-migrant riots in Spain,https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-misinformation-fuels-anti-migrant-riots-in-spain/a-73314931?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T13:21:00Z,"Several days of unrest in the town of Torre Pacheco, near Murcia, have highlighted rising tensions overmigrationin Spain. Sixty-eight-year-old pensioner Domingo Tomas Martinez had said he was beaten up by migrants on July 9. The motive of the attack was not immediately clear. But it was followedby several nights of riots and violent protests. Far-right groups posted xenophobic messages on social media, calling for people to""hunt down""migrants. This further escalated tensions. Torre Pachecois a coastal Spanish town of nearly 40,000 people, anda third of its populationconsists of migrants, according to local government data. Police claim that by now peace has been largely restored in the city after the attack. But this is another example of how misinformation can ignite emotions. A video showing an elderly man being assaulted by unidentified persons heightened tensions. The video was widely shared on different social media platforms, it appeared for instance onFacebookand X. Claim:ThisX postwith the video, from July 10, states: ""A video has been leaked of a brutal attack on an elderly man by North Africans in Torre-Pacheco, Murcia."" The post comes from a user with a gold checkmark on their X account, indicating that the account belongs to an official organization through verified organizations. Other accountsalso sharedthe video claiming it showed the attack on Martinez. DW Fact Check:False The video is not from Torre Pacheco. It is related toan incidentthat took place nearly two months ago and was filmed in the city of Almeria, more than 200 kilometers away. The person seen in the video is Jose Moya. After the video went viral in July, Moya posted hisstatementon Instagram clarifying that the person seen in the viral video is, in fact, him. Local media outletsinterviewedhim after the viral video sparked social media outrage against migrants. Moya also showed the T-shirt and trousers on Instagram that he wore on the day of the attack. Calling for justice, he said, ""The one in the video is me. I'm having a hard time making this video because I'm so nervous. But they are getting confused. And what I want to say is that I ask for justice for everything they have done to me and for the old man. The old man is a man from Murcia, and I am from Almeria. I was the one who was beaten."" He explained that two people attacked him while more were present. He said they asked him for tobacco, and when he replied that he didn’t have any, ""They got into a fight with me (…). They cut my head open, broke three ribs, and left me there unconscious."" He claimed the attackers were Spanish, and not migrants. DW Fact Check could confirm the scene in the video was filmed in Almeria, as claimed by Jose Moya in his Instagram post. He also showed a picture of the location taken after the incident, which is included in his video statement.  Wegeo-locatedit near the Centro Periferico de Especialidades (Bola Azul) hospital. The footage matches details such as a row of trees, graffiti, and similar ground. Domingo Tomas Martinez, the man beaten up in Torre Pacheco, has also confirmed that he is not in the video that went viral. He spoke toseveralmediaoutletsfollowing the incident, where he appeared with red eyes and other marks of assault. Similar misleading posts emerged following the case in Murcia, many targeting migrants and Muslims. Here are two examples: Claim:Thisposton X claims that Torre Pacheco's local police were attacked by migrants and that the Civil Guard did not intervene: ""The Torre Pacheco Local Police, overwhelmed by the mob of broccoli-haired people."" DW Fact Check:False This incident took place inTorrevieja, about 40 kilometers from Torre Pacheco. Police officers were attacked by several individuals of migrant background there,reportedmultiple local media outlets. DW verified and identified thelocationof thevideo. Claim:Anotherpostclaimed a ""ham protest"" was organized to respond to the Torre Pacheco incident. The caption reads, ""Torre Pacheco wakes up early. The residents are organizing for the final counter attack."" DW fact check:False This video is unrelated. It was firstpostedin November 2024 on X by a user saying it was an attempt to set a world record for the largest plate of ham. The video was filmed in Huelva and has been viewed more than 2.4 million times since then. Misinformation isn't just a harmless mistake: It can spark violence, fuel hatred, and put lives at risk, as seen in Torre Pacheco: False claims on social media led to further escalations and deep divisions in the community. Before sharing a post,pause and verify the facts. A single misleading video can ignite real world chaos. Check sources, consult fact-checks, and think critically. Stopping the spread of misinformation starts with each one of us.

Japan: Far-right parties play immigration card ahead of vote,https://www.dw.com/en/japan-far-right-parties-play-immigration-card-ahead-of-vote/a-73322597?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T11:31:00Z,"Far-right forces inJapanhope to capitalize on growing immigration concerns as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) andPrime Minister Shigeru Ishibabrace for a tough election on Sunday. The Japanese are set to vote for just over half of the 248 seats in the country's House of Councilors, the upper chamber of the Japanese parliament. Ishiba's LDP and the allied Komeito party need to win at least 50 of those seats in order to maintain their majority.  But even this relatively low bar might prove to be too much amid LDP's tumbling popularity. Whilethe LDP is considered conservative, voters perceive it as moving to more centrist positions in recent years. Now, Ishiba is fending off attacks from unabashedly nationalist parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan, whose immigration policies are similar tothe far-right Alternative for Germany(AFD) orDonald Trump'sMAGA movement in the US. Michael Cucek, a professor of politics and international relations at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, says part of the anti-foreigner sentiment is fanned byunruly touristscausing mayhem in the previously serene backstreets of Kyoto and other traditional towns. ""The weak yen has brought in tens of millions of foreign tourists and all the Japanese see is groups of tourists arriving with their suitcases in AirB&B apartments in quiet neighborhoods, being noisy and not following the rules on disposing of garbage correctly,"" he said. There were a record 21.51 million tourist arrivals in the first half of 2025, an increase of 21% over the same period of last year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Officials are anticipating more than 40 million arrivals by the end of the year, with the nation on course to meet the government's target of 60 million foreign visitors annually in 2030. Soaring numbers of tourists may help the national economy, but with Japan's strict cultural norms, many visitors breed resentment if their behavior is raucous, thoughtless or demanding. Such incidents are also invariably picked up by the Japanese media. The media is also quick to report on crimes committed by foreigners living in Japan. Much was made of the arrest of a group of four Vietnamese who entered Japan on tourist visas in 2024 but spent the following two weeks traveling around the country stealing clothes from branches of the Uniqlo chain of clothing stores. Elsewhere, foreigners have been accused of stealing cars for components, taking crops from farmers' fields, sexually abusing women and a plethora of similar offenses. Defenders of immigration point out that Japanese businesses are crying out for labor asbirth rates continue to dropand the number of elderly people grows. But Souhei Kamiya, founder of the far-right Sanseito party, says ""Japan should not rely on foreign workers."" ""Our position is that we will accept those with skills for fixed durations on the understanding that they are not immigrants and they must leave again after a fixed period,"" Kamiya said at a press conference in Tokyo two weeks ago. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The politician also said that ""Japan should be run by leveraging Japanese capabilities,"" and that the party will tolerate foreigners who follow the nation's laws and traditions, but those who ignore them have no place in Japan. According to Kamiya, many foreign laborers who have been brought into Japan have quickly absconded from their approved work sites ""and turned to criminal organizations to make money, such as through robbery."" ""Japan's population is expected to drop from around 120 million at present, but even if it falls to 80 million — the same as Germany — then there will be enough people to maintain the country,"" Kamiya told reporters. Yoichi Shimada, a lawmaker for the similarly right-leaning Conservative Party of Japan, shares many of Sanseito's positions and says one of his concerns is foreign nationals purchasing land and property in Japan. ""Rich Chinese are the biggest problem,"" he claimed. ""They are buying land and apartments in Tokyo and around the country and that is a worry because it is impossible to get rich in China without the support of the Chinese Communist Party."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video ""The Chinese government is deliberately colonizing Japan and that is a security threat,"" he told DW, insisting that there were records to showChineseindividuals or corporations buying land close to strategic military bases in Japan astension grows between the two Asian nations. Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, says Japan's far right has been ""inspired"" by the success of Trump's ""America First"" campaigns, with Sanseito even mimicking that slogan with its own ""Japanese First."" ""These right-wing groups' positions are in many ways the same as the MAGA movement and are based on the concept of Japanese exclusivity,"" she said. ""The truth, of course, is that legal immigrants benefit the Japanese economy because of our well-publicized labor shortages — but these claims resonate with people who want to promote the purity or superiority of the Japanese race."" She took issue with the far right blaming immigrants for rising crime figures, pointing out that 10,963 foreigners were arrested in 2020, but that figure had fallen to 9,726 arrests in 2023. In the same time period, the number of foreign residents of Japan had increased from 2.75 million to 3.4 million. ""People are struggling with economic problems at home and it is easy to blame foreigners for the problems in society,"" Murakami said. ""There is an economic downturn, prices are up, there is concern because of the US tariffs, but it is easy for people to take their frustrations out on foreigners."" Edited by: Darko Janjevic"
EU agrees on 18th sanctions package on Russia,https://www.dw.com/en/eu-agrees-on-18th-sanctions-package-on-russia/a-73319055?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T08:56:00Z,"The 27 member states of theEuropean Unionon Friday agreed upon an 18th round of sanctions onRussiaover its full-scaleinvasion of Ukraine. Slovakiahad been holding up the decision, citing concerns over its gas imports. But Slovakian Prime MinisterRobert Ficorelented, saying he had instructed representatives to approve the measures. Fico said that persisting would be ""counterproductive"" for Slovakia's interests as an EU member. ""The EU just approved one of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date,"" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. ""Each sanction weakens Russia's ability to wage war. The message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war."" German Chancellor Friedrich Merzsaid the decision ""weakens Russia's ability to continue financing the war against Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyalso welcomed the sanctions. ""This decision is essential and timely, especially now, as a response to the fact that Russia has intensified the brutality of the strikes on our cities and villages,"" he said on social media. The sanctions package targets Moscow's financial and energy sectors. It comes afterUS efforts toward a ceasefire in Ukraine failed to materialize. The EU has agreed to lower the price cap on Russian oil exported to third countries to 15% below market value. This is meant to reduce Russia's income by banning shipping and insurance companies that let Russia sell above the cap. The cap was originally a G7 initiative, but the US is not party to the EU's new sanctions. EU officials have admitted this weakens their impact. Brussels has issued several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin launched Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. More than 2,400 officials and ""entities"" have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans. But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree upon, as measures targeting Russia begin to hit the economies of the 27 member states. In May, the block targeted almost 200 ships in Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. Friday's measures added another 100 ships to that list.

The US now lists The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the TRF a ""front and proxy"" ofPakistan-basedLashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a UN-designated terrorist group. Rubio said in a statement that the move reflects Washington's commitment to counterterrorism and enforces US PresidentDonald Trump's""call for justice” over the Pahalgam killings. India welcomed the US decision, with Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar calling it a ""strong affirmation"" of India-US counterterrorism cooperation. In a statement, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) called ""the designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counter-terrorism,""The Indian Expressnewspaper reported. Experts see the US move as a sign ofdeepening support for Indiain the wake of the April terrorist attack. ""This can be a shot in the arm for a U.S.-India relationship looking to rebound after a few tough months,"" said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for Foreign Policy magazine told Reuters news agency. The move comes a day after it was reported that Trump would visit Pakistan in September, although this was not confirmed by Pakistani authorities. The April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26mostly Hindu touristsinIndian-administered Kashmir, was the deadliest involving civilians in India since 2008. WhileIndia blamed Pakistanfor backing the attackers, Islamabad denied involvement and called for a neutral probe. The incident sparked amajor escalation in hostilitiesbetween the two South Asian nuclear-armed neighbors as the conflict escalated into airstrikes, drone and artillery attacks before a ceasefire was reached on May 10.

Brazil's Lula says Trump tariffs 'unacceptable blackmail',https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-s-lula-says-trump-tariffs-unacceptable-blackmail/a-73318638?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T04:05:00Z,"Left-wing Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, condemned US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and criticism of the Brazilian judiciary in a televised address on Thursday. Trump has threatened50% tariffs on Brazilian goodsstarting from August 1. The US president has said the tariffs would stay in place until legal charges were dropped against former conservative Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is on trial over allegations that he was involved in a coup attempt after the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Lula. Bolsonaro has denied the allegations. Lula called the the tariff threat from Trump ""unacceptable blackmail."" He also said ""attempting to interfere in Brazilian justice is a grave attack on national sovereignty."" Lula characterized Brazilian politicians who back Trump's policies as ""traitors to the homeland."" ""No foreigner is going to give order to this president,""Lulasaid, using the word ""gringo"" to refer to Trump. The word ""gringo"" is commonly used by Brazilians, it refers to foreigners and is not used in an offensive manner. In an interview earlier Thursday with CNN, Lula denied that the proceedings against Bolsonaro are politically motivated. ""The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,"" he said. Although Lula has criticized Trump, he has emphasized that he wants a ""good relationship"" with the US president. Lula's condemnation of Trump comes as the US president posted a sympathy letter aimed at Bolsonaro on his Truth Social account. ""I have seen the terrible treatment you are receiving at the hands of an unjust system turned against you,"" Trump said in his letter to Bolsonaro. ""I have strongly voiced my disapproval both publicly and through our tariff policy."" Trump also alluded to the suspension of the conservative video platformRumblein Brazil, saying that the Latin American nation is cracking down on free speech. As Trump lashes out at the legal proceedings against Bolsonaro,TheWashington Postnewspaper reported that the Trump administration is considering sanctions against a key Brazilian Supreme Court judge. Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes will be tasked with deciding whether Bolsonaro and codefendants will spend dozens of years in jail over the coup charges.TheWashington Postreported that Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, is working with US officials to impose sanctions on Moraes. The dispute between the US and Brazil comes ahead of Brazilian presidential elections next year. Lula has suggested that he does not rule out a 2026 presidential run, and he may emphasize his Brazilian sovereignty message as a key part of his electoral platform if the feud with Trump continues into next year.

Trump requests release of documents related to Epstein case,https://www.dw.com/en/trump-requests-release-of-documents-related-to-epstein-case/a-73318735?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-18T03:30:00Z,"US President Donald Trumpdirected Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday to release the grand jury testimony related to theJeffrey Epsteincase, following court approval. ""This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!"" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform, decrying the ""ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein."" Shortly after Trump's statement, Bondi said on X that the Justice Department was ready to move the court on Friday to unseal the grand jury transcripts. Trump's latest announcement on the Epstein case came shortly after his threats to sueThe Wall Street Journalnewspaper over a story that the president wrote a crude letter to Epstein. The letter allegedly featured a drawing of a naked woman — including Trump's signature as part of the drawing — that was part of a collection of notes for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump strongly denied writing the note, calling it ""false, malicious, and defamatory,"" and claiming the newspaper ignored his direct denials. ""President Trump will be suingThe Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. [Rupert] Murdoch, shortly. The Press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don't even exist,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. The president was alreadyunder intense scrutinyfor his previous ties to Epstein. Trump is among several high-profile figures who were once acquainted with Epstein, though he denies ever visiting Epstein's infamous estate in the US Virgin Islands. Epstein, a wealthy financier, was arrested onchild sex traffickingand in conspiracy charges. He died by suicide in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His death sparked numerous conspiracy theories. During the 2024 election campaign, Trump promised to release files relating to Epstein, but later backtracked, urging his Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters toforget about the files. Many of Trump's supporters, notably those in the core MAGA movement, are accusing the administration of shielding powerful figures allegedly tied to the case. The Epstein case is the most prominent rift between Trump and his loyal MAGA base ahead of the 2026 midterms. Trump has been accused numerous times of sexual assault. In January 2024, acourt ordered him to pay $83.3 million to E. Jean Carrollin defamation damages for denying he raped her three decades ago.

""In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs,"" Leavitt told journalists at a White House press briefing. She said medical tests ""revealed chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70."" Trump is 79 years old. The announcement comes amid speculation regarding images showing Trump with a bruised hand and swollen legs. Leavitt claimed that the bruised hand was due to Trump shaking hands with so many people and because he takes aspirin. Trump takes aspirin to mitigate heart attack and stroke risk. Leavitt said laboratory testing found no evidence that Trump faces ""deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease."" A letter published by the White House from presidential physician Sean Barbabella said Trump ""remains in excellent health."" According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website,CVI occurswhen ""leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to your heart."" Johns Hopkins School of Medicine said CVI is ""not a serious health threat."" Stanford Medicinefound that CVI can cause fluid to pool in the legs, causing swelling. The White House's statements that Trump's health is in good shape comes as Trump has attacked the previousPresident Joe Biden, with Trump claiming Biden covered up his prostate cancer diagnosis. Biden, who served as president from January 2021 to January 2025, announced he had prostate cancer in May. Biden's office has denied that 82-year-old Biden covered his cancer diagnosis during his presidency. Trump and Biden are the oldest ever occupants of the White House, with their health put under a microscope by the US public. During Trump's first term in 2020, he was diagnosed with COVID-19, with Trump having to spent time in Walter Reed Military Hospital in Washington DC to recover. Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospital stay was the focus of wall-to-wall media coverage. Edited by: Dmytro Hubenko"

Slovakiahad been holding up the 18th EU sanctions package against Russia over concerns regarding a separate EU plan to stop gas imports from Russia beginning in 2028. Any new sanctions package requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU member states. ""At this point, it would be counterproductive to continue blocking the 18th sanctions package tomorrow,"" Fico said in a video posted on Facebook. He said Slovakia received guarantees from the EU pertaining to gas prices and supply. Fico also said ""further dialogue is needed"" to ensure Slovakia's energy security.

The sanctions would prohibit EU operators from using the RussianNord Stream pipelinesthat extend from Russia toGermany. The measures would also decrease the oil price cap from $60 (€52) to $45 per barrel. Exports of oil and gas is a major boon for the Russian economy, with EU countries seeking to reduce or phase out their reliance on Russian fossil fuels since the Moscow'sfull-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Germany ended direct imports of Russian gas in the summer of 2022.

What are Israel's interests and objectives in Syria?,https://www.dw.com/en/what-are-israel-s-interests-and-objectives-in-syria/a-73313624?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf,2025-07-17T19:16:00Z,"Even before the sun had risen on Thursday, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa had already made several announcements on national television. In a dawn speech, he said that theinternal unrestbetween Sunni Bedouins and theDruze minority, resulting in the deaths of around 360 people in the southern province of Sweida, had ended. He also confirmed government forces were no longer deployed in the area. Al-Sharaa then underscored his commitment toprotectthe rights and freedoms of the Druze community and reaffirmed their place inSyriansociety. But the main part of his speech was directed at Syria's neighbor Israel. This week, Israel launched attacks on Syrian government buildings inDamascusand Syrian troops in the Sweida region, resulting in the deaths of 20 people. According to Israel's Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, the attacks were necessary ""to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime."" Yet, in al-Sharaa's view,Israelwas only exploiting the unrest by targeting civilian infrastructure and seeking to derail peace and reconstruction efforts in his country. ""We, the people of Syria, know very well who is trying todrag us into warand who is working to divide us,"" al-Sharaa said, adding that ""we will not give them the opportunity to entangle our people in a war that serves only to fragment our homeland and sow destruction."" The latest strikes on the Syrian capital mark anescalationof Israel's military campaign in the country. Israel started bombing Syria much more frequently after the overthrow of the country's dictator, Bashar Assad, in early December 2024, ostensibly to ensure that Assad's weapons didn't fall into the hands of the new government. According to Charles Lister, head of the Washington-based Middle East Institute's Syria initiative, Israel has carried out just under 1,000 strikes on Syria, and occupied 180 square kilometers of the country since December 2024. Lister notes that Syria's government has not retaliated at all. Officially, the countries have been at war since 1967. That year, Israel occupied Syria'sGolan Heights, a strategic plateau at the border, and then effectively annexed it in 1981. However the international community regards the Golan Heights as Syrian territory under Israeli military occupation. The US and Israel recognize the territory as Israeli. After Assad's fall, Israeli troopshave moved beyond a demilitarized zone along the Israel-Syria border that's been monitored by the United Nationssince a 1974 ceasefire deal between the two countries. ""Israel is trying to carve out an informal buffer zone in southern Syria,"" Ryan Bohl, senior Middle East and North African analyst at the US-based security intelligence firm Rane Networktoldnews agency Bloomberg this week. Earlier in March, Israel's Netanyahu said Syria's south must be a demilitarized zone. ""The recent strikes are a message to the government in Damascus that Israel follows with interest and concern what is happening in Syria,"" Yossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations atLondon's Regent’s University, told DW. ""One of the problems with the current Israeli government is that its only modus operandi is using force,"" he added. ""There is pressure in Israel to protect the Druze, as there is a long and deep-rooted alliance between the Druze and Jews in Israel,"" Mekelberg said. In Israel, the Druze are a community of around 150,000. Druze men regularly serve in the Israeli military. In Syria, around 700,000 Druze make up one of Syria's largest minorities. But it's been suggested that the timing of Israel's strikes on Syria this week was also key. On Wednesday, Netanyahu had to appear in court as part of hisongoing corruption trial. His coalition government has also become increasingly fragile after two parties left it earlier this month. This could lead to general elections at the beginning of 2026. Netanyahu has also been under increasing pressure by the US and European states to end the war inGazaand is faced with calls for the return of the hostages still held by Gaza-based militant group Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist group by the US and many other countries. And Netanyahu is dealing with domestic and international condemnation for thehumanitarian catastrophein Gaza as a result of Israel's ongoing military campaign there. ""Considering Netanyahu's show of unabated cynicism and opportunism he could be using situations [such as the clashes involving Syria's Druze minority] to deflect from his legal affairs and the crisis within his coalition,"" Mekelberg said. ""Keeping at least one front open and portraying himself, despiteOctober 7, as 'Mr. Security,' especially when he might contemplate early general elections, is the way that he has always operated."" Next week the Israeli parliament goes on summer break which will pause domestic politics until October. Israel's other objective is for Syria to be a very weak state or to be a broken state so that it is unable to threaten Israel, the Rane Network's Bohl told Bloomberg. This seems to be happening, says Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the think tank International Crisis Group. ""Damascus came out weakened from the recent clashes, it was forced to retreat militarily [and] it lost the trust of not only the Druze community but also ofdifferent communitiesthat are not aligned with the state,"" he told DW. In his view, Syria is now even more fragile. ""Damascus also lost geopolitically as the government has now less presence in the south, especially in Sweida,"" he said. He doubts that Syria's interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa could keep his promise and protect the Druze minority. ""It seems to be more a political gesture than a credible guarantee,"" Hawach said, explaining that government forces were seen as siding with anti-Druze militias and there were credible reports of some units abusing Druze civilians. ""Unless Damascus reforms its security approach and holds its forces accountable, it will struggle to convince the Druze, or other minority communities, that it can genuinely ensure their safety,"" he concluded.

"How to quit your smartphone addiction, guided by science",https://www.dw.com/en/how-to-quit-your-smartphone-addiction-guided-by-science/a-73309415?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-17T11:07:00Z,"We spend 4 hours and 37 minutes on ourphoneseach day, checking them around 58 times, on average. We like to tell ourselves it's to socialize, for work, or to read the news. But most of us are addicted, and we know it. You can test whether you are on theSmartphone Addiction Scale here. How prevalent is smartphone addiction? Study after study confirms that people are becoming increasingly addicted to smartphones — in every country tested, and in all ages. In the US, for example, nearly 57% of those asked in a recent surveyadmitted to being addicted to their phones. ""There is evidence that problematic smartphone use impacts negatively on the lives of many people. There are associations between problematic smartphone use and mental health symptoms, such as depression and anxiety,"" said Zaheer Hussain, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University, UK. People aregetting tired of their smartphone behaviors— as is often the case with an addiction. But the hard part is that people wanting to beat smartphone addiction can find it as hard as those whowant to quit smoking— it's a difficult psychological battle. Social apps, boredom, or simple daily habits can have you reaching for your phone often without realizing it. But the long-term health benefits of reducing your smartphone habits are huge. Studies show smartphone addiction is linked with a range of health issues, including sleep disturbances, eye strain, physical inactivity, and neck and back pain. Mentally, it contributes to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and impacts attention and memory,especially in teenagers. Smartphone addiction can also be caused by those very same mental challenges. So, beating smartphone addiction can also help those struggles.

It's similar to gambling orvideo-game addictionin that there's no addictive 'substance', such as a drug like cocaine. Yes, apps and websites are designed to keep our attentions locked in, usinggamificationas a tool to get us addicted. Many people report using smartphones to escape from stressful situations in the home. It's an escapist tool that can take the mind off depressing thoughts and feelings of anxiety. But it is difficult to know whether smartphone addiction is a cause of mental health challenges, or a result of them. That's why an important part of beating smartphone addiction is understanding why you became addicted in the first place. There's no quick fix to beating smartphoneaddiction. Different people need different methods, often more than one. And it takes real dedication. But scientists have verified several methods to helpbeat smartphone addiction. Most of these are similar to tools used to beat other behavioral addictions, and often rely on behavioral re-training. Here are some methods that scientists recommend: To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The scientific consensus is that the more methods you use at the same time, the better your chances are of beating your smartphone addiction in the long term. One clinical trialtested a ten-step behavioral program called the nudge-based intervention. It used multiple approaches like those listed above. ""The steps aimed to make the phone a little less rewarding to use, add a bit of friction to use it, and reduce the number of reminders to use the phone. This nudge-based intervention aimed to reduce problematic smartphone use without relying on willpower alone,"" said the study's lead author, Jay Olson, an addiction psychologist at University of Toronto in Canada. It proved effective in the short term, returning problematic smartphone use scores to normal levels for at least 6 weeks. ""However, we have less data on which interventions work over the long term for years,"" Olson told DW. Other clinical trials have shown how physical interventions help as well: Replacing smartphone use with exercise or sports effectively reduced smartphone addiction in university students, for example. This can also help reduce loneliness, anxiety, and stress levels that oftenaccompany smartphone addiction. Hussain said simply getting out into nature more can greatly benefit your mental health. ""If we don't get out in nature then our phones and in extension social media, notifications, news reels, scrolling take over our lives. This can lead to anxiety and depression, and other mental health issues,"" said Hussain. Smartphone addiction has become a significant health issue among students withmental health challenges. The addiction can feed and exacerbate those challenges. Studies show how people who have an addiction to smartphones often become bored quickly, are more socially isolated, and express the tendency to feel lost without their smartphones. If you feel your smartphone use is having an impact on your mental health, your relationships and your everyday life, it may be time to seek professional help. ""Several therapies have been shown to be effective, such as mindfulness therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy,"" said Olson. Talk therapies, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can provide step-by-step ways to stop compulsive behaviors and change your perceptions about your phone. These therapies can help identify why you are addicted and help you tackle those issues at the root. Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany"
Vibrio bacteria: How to swim in European waters and survive,https://www.dw.com/en/vibrio-bacteria-how-to-swim-in-european-waters-and-survive/a-73299934?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-16T13:24:00Z,"Scientists attribute a lot to climate change these days — with some things being easier to prove than others. When it comes toVibriobacterialinfections, there appears to be a strong link — becauseVibriobacteria thrive in warm waters, especially when salt levels are low. And in the Baltic Sea, sea surface temperatures are indeed going up, while salinity levels are going down, which researchers have linked to the effects of climate change. As sea temperatures rise, so do the numbers ofVibrioinfections in Nordic countries bordering the Baltic Sea. Vibrioinfections remain relatively rare, but health agencies like the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warn of increased risks ofVibrioinfections duringsummers with extended heatwaves. Vibriobacteria cause vibriosis andcholera. For the purpose of this article, we are focusing on vibriosis, which is sometimes referred to as vibriosis (non-cholera). Vibriosis is an infection that can become serious and life-threatening, especially among people with weakened immune systems. The main types ofVibriobacteria that cause human infection areVibrio vulnificus,Vibrio parahaemolyticus, andVibrio alginolyticus, but there are at least a dozen types. SomeVibrioinfections can lead to the death of flesh around an open wound (known asnecrotizing fasciitis). Rarer types ofVibrio vulnificusinfections can cause serious illness, requiring intensive care or limb amputation. In the US, about 1 in 5 people die within two days of contracting aVibrio vulnificusinfection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC estimates around 80,000 illnesses and 100 deaths fromVibrioinfections annually in the US. Most people get vibriosis in the gut by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, such as oysters, mussels and clams. You can also get it by swallowing water when swimming in infected coastal waters. You can also get a blood infection when bacteria enter the body through cuts to the skin, either when swimming or, for example, when on land, water from shellfish drips onto an open wound. People with pre-existing conditions may have a higher risk of infection. This includes people with liver damage through hepatitis, liver disease, excessive alcohol or drug use. But also people withcancer,diabetes,HIV— those on immune-suppressing therapies — or those taking medicine to reduce stomach acid. Vibriosis cannot be transmitted from one person to another. To avoid vibriosis, do not eat raw or uncooked shellfish. Health agencies also recommend avoiding swimming in brackish waters or saltwater if you have open wounds. And if you get a cut while swimming, leave the water and have it cleaned and properly dressed. If you have an existing condition, know yourimmune systemto be compromised, or have recently had any surgery and want to swim in a coastal area, check with your doctor for appropriate advice. The symptoms of vibriosis depend on the type of infection. But, generally, they are similar to those of most other common infections, likeinfluenzaor an upset stomach: Signs of a bloodstream vibriosis infection include extremely low blood pressure and blistering around skin lesions. AndVibriowound infections can cause symptoms like redness, pain, swelling and weeping wounds. In Europe, theBaltic Seais a prime location forVibriobacteria. That affects people in coastal areas of Denmark, northeastern Germany, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In theNorth Sea, the bacteria live around the Dutch and Belgian coasts. And towards southeastern Europe, they are concentrated in theBlack Sea, affecting people in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Ukraine. The total number ofVibrioillnesses in Europe annually is in the hundreds. A significant spike was observed in 2018, when 445 cases were reported. North America and Southeast Asia are similarly affected. Brackish coastal locations are good breading grounds forVibriobacteria — first, because that is where saltwater and freshwater mix; and second, because they are often enclosed or estuarine. The bacteria can thrive, almost undisturbed. Climate change has not causedVibriobacteria outbreaks. However, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warned on July 11, 2025, that favorable conditions forVibriobacteria were becoming ""increasingly common in parts of Europe due to climate change."" In June 2025, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said: ""[R]ecent marineheatwaves have led to unprecedented levels of vibriosis infectionsalong the Baltic Sea and North Sea coasts."" According to the EEA's calculations, average sea surface temperatures in the Baltic rose from less than -1 ºC in 1990 to about 0.5 ºC in 2024. Other studies over the past decade have suggested that increased river-runoff into the Baltic, due to climate change, was adding more freshwater to the estuarine area and therefore decreasing salinity levels. So, climate change is not to blame for vibriosis, but it is increasing the threat. Edited by: Fred Schwaller"
Trump receives vein issue diagnosis amid leg swelling rumors,https://www.dw.com/en/trump-receives-vein-issue-diagnosis-amid-leg-swelling-rumors/a-73318348?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-18T01:46:00Z,"US PresidentDonald Trumphas been diagnosed with a common, benign vein condition, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday. ""In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs,"" Leavitt told journalists at a White House press briefing. She said medical tests ""revealed chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70."" Trump is 79 years old. The announcement comes amid speculation regarding images showing Trump with a bruised hand and swollen legs. Leavitt claimed that the bruised hand was due to Trump shaking hands with so many people and because he takes aspirin. Trump takes aspirin to mitigate heart attack and stroke risk. Leavitt said laboratory testing found no evidence that Trump faces ""deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease."" A letter published by the White House from presidential physician Sean Barbabella said Trump ""remains in excellent health."" According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website,CVI occurswhen ""leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to your heart."" Johns Hopkins School of Medicine said CVI is ""not a serious health threat."" Stanford Medicinefound that CVI can cause fluid to pool in the legs, causing swelling. The White House's statements that Trump's health is in good shape comes as Trump has attacked the previousPresident Joe Biden, with Trump claiming Biden covered up his prostate cancer diagnosis. Biden, who served as president from January 2021 to January 2025, announced he had prostate cancer in May. Biden's office has denied that 82-year-old Biden covered his cancer diagnosis during his presidency. Trump and Biden are the oldest ever occupants of the White House, with their health put under a microscope by the US public. During Trump's first term in 2020, he was diagnosed with COVID-19, with Trump having to spent time in Walter Reed Military Hospital in Washington DC to recover. Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospital stay was the focus of wall-to-wall media coverage. Edited by: Dmytro Hubenko"
Fact check: Does sunscreen increase the risk for skin cancer?,https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-does-sunscreen-increase-the-risk-for-skin-cancer/a-73242617?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-17T11:26:00Z,"Posts on social media have popped up recently, claiming that applyingsunscreenreportedly increases therisk of skin cancer.Even though ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main cause of melanomas, and sunscreen helps protect skin by filtering UV rays, these posts claim thatsunscreenitself is doing damage. Claim:""It is an indisputable fact that the countries that use the most sunscreen, have the highest incidence of skin cancer,"" saidthis X userin a post with close to 60,000 followers. ""And the more sunscreen they use, the greater the prevalence."" There are alsoTikTok videoswarning about sunscreen. DW Fact check:False ""There is no scientific evidence that supports the association of sunscreen use with a higher risk of cancer,"" Brittany Schaefer, Public Information Officer with theConnecticut State Department of Public Healthtold DW. The X post attributed the chart to the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR), but Schaefer says that was inaccurate. ""The original cancer incidence data likely came from the CT Tumor Registry decades ago, but not the added text boxes regarding sunscreens. We do not know the source of the actual graphic, but it was not from CTR or the Connecticut Department of Public Health,"" she said. But why is the number of global skin cancer cases on the rise, even though more and more people are using sunscreen? Astudy across several countries from December 2023involving scientists from the US, Switzerland, Germany and Hungary looked at five hypotheses to get to the bottom of this. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video According to the study, possible reasons for misunderstandings and myths around linking skin cancer risk and sun protection include access to better diagnostics and treatment methods, outdated scientific studies, erratic use of sunscreen andclimate change. Rising awareness about skin cancer risks among both patients and doctors has led to an increase in reporting and documenting cases. In contrast to higher skin cancer incidence worldwide, the mortality rate has dropped due to better treatment options, says the World Health Organization'sInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. According to theWorld Cancer Research Fund,Australia had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of new cases in 2022: 37 new skin cancer cases per 100,000 people per year, followed by Denmark (31.1), Norway (30.6), New Zealand (29.8) and Sweden (27.4). The US ranked first with 101,388 cases in terms of the total number of skin cancer cases in 2022, while Germany ranked second with 21,976 skin cancer cases, with an identical incidence rate of 16.5. In terms of the number of skin cancer deaths in 2022, the US again took the lead with 7,368 deaths, while Germany ranked fourth with 3,303 cases, behind China and Russia. The following graph also shows that a high incidence rate of skin cancer does not necessarily correspond to a higher mortality rate. Another reason for rising skin cancer rates could also be the fact that people spend more time outside in the sun. Even if they applied sunscreen, that was no guarantee that they used it as intended to protect their skin. The lack of current scientific studies further adds to the problem of reinforcing outdated narratives. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only began regulating sunscreen in 2011. All prior studies examining sunscreen use and the development of melanoma were likely conducted with products that did not offer the same level of protection as those currently on the market. But are people in countries with the highest rates of skin cancer cases such as New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Canada and the US really using more sunscreen, as users on social media have claimed? It is true that the global sale of sunscreen is on the rise. And according to thesunscreen industry,the revenue of global sun protection skin care is projected to reach about $13.553 million (€11.594 million) by 2028. The biggest markets are the US, followed by China and South Korea. And then there's the question of how people are using sunscreen. According to theAustralian Bureau of Statistics,38% of people aged 15 years and over said they used SPF30 or higher on most days in the last month. However, 7% said they had experienced sunburn in the last week. Young people aged 15–24 years were more likely to experience sunburn in the last week (about 15%). A poll in the US byTalker Research, published in May of this year, found that less than half (41%) of the 2,000 adults polled said they wear sunscreen more than 60 days of the year. And 13% said they typically don't wear sunscreen at all. In Germany, about half of the people asked in anonline poll from August 2024said they would only use sunscreen in summer or when being directly in the sun. Sybille Kohlstädt, spokesperson for the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), warns against false conclusions due to a lack of valid data regarding sun protection. ""In contrast to existing data on the growing global prevalence of skin cancer, there are no country-specific statistics that break down sunscreen use and relate it to skin cancer prevalence.""

Brain training for school kids: A boost for learning?,https://www.dw.com/en/brain-training-for-school-kids-a-boost-for-learning/a-73273124?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-14T13:12:00Z,"The years of educational disruption during the COVID pandemic have had profound effects on children's learning outcomes, worldwide. Children frompoorer socioeconomic backgrounds have been particularly affected. Research suggests thatchildren's cognitive skills are declining— reflected in kids having weaker memories, attention spans, and diminished flexible thinking skills. So, some experts are suggesting that specialized 'brain training' programs be used in schools toimprove those skills. Cognitive scientists are interested in testing whether these will help train children's working memory, with brain training programs that present kids with puzzles and other challenges. The working memory is themind's staging area, where information is processed in the short term. It's the bit that you use when you're struggling through a math or logic problem — the part of our mind that can feel blocked when you can't find a solution. ""The challenge is that some children's working memories are limited, and it's a huge bottleneck for learning,"" said Thomas Perry, a social scientist and education researcher at the University of Warwick, UK. Brain training programs claim to boost these brain skills. One recent study claimed to show that a 12-hour workingmemory training program had improved children's focus, IQ and long-term academic outcomes. The study followed 572Germanschoolchildren aged 6–7 years over three years. One group of children completed a 12-hour-long working memory training over a period of 5 weeks. The kids who did the training missed out on an equivalent time of mathematics or German classes. Meanwhile, a control group of children had regular classes. They found that children who completed the training had increases in working memory capacity up to a year after the training. Three years after the program, researchers found that the trained children had 16% higher chances of entering an academic track at secondary school — 46% instead of the average 30%. ""I was surprised by the breadth of benefits, not just for working memory and closely related academic subjects. Even broader capacities such as IQ and self-control improved,"" said Torkel Klingberg, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute, Sweden, who designed the intervention but was not involved in the study. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The children in the study trained working memory through a series of different cognitive tasks, including visuospatial tests to see whether they would remember where things were on a screen. They used a publicly available app calledNuroe, which the study authors claim can help strengthen children's core learning system in thebrain. Perry, who was not involved in the research, said the study correctly measured how working memory training mediated academic performance. However, he said, ""We can't make grand claims based on one study. We need to verify the results with large scale efficacy trials in different schools and with different teachers."" Already, however, he said there were indications that teachers who thought boosting IQ and critical thinking were important were teaching less substantive information related to the curriculum. ""This is damaging for some kids. For example, disadvantaged kids oftenaren't immersed in reading at home, so they really need dedicated time at school for learning to read. Replacing reading time with working memory training might be harmful in the long term."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Perry was involved in a large-scale review of over 400 studies testing different cognitive training programs in schools. The review, conducted by theUK's Education Endowment Foundation, found that studies testing cognitive training in research settings (not in classrooms) tend to show impressive effects on kids' learning. But when they are tested in classrooms, they tend to show limited results. ""There's a picture emerging from the research is that some studies show working memory training is potentially effective in certain settings, but other studies show no effect at all,"" Perry said. ""We don't have this critical body of studies to say that working memory training is a good thing to teach students, or how to do it,"" Perry said. Large-scale brain training programs in US schools, for example, showedno or very small effects on kids' educational outcomes. Meta-analyseshave found that working memory training programs do not improve overall cognitive performance or measures of intelligence in the long term. Some experts have said that workingmemory training programsdo not generalize to ""real-world"" cognitive skills. ""Critical thinking skills, for example, are based on knowledge that's built up over time. If you have critical thinking, say, about science, it doesn't necessarily translate to other subjects,"" said Perry. ""So, I doubt we can double kids' working memory and make them suddenly superintelligent."" Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany"
Weight loss drugs linked with growing number of side effects,https://www.dw.com/en/weight-loss-drugs-linked-with-growing-number-of-side-effects/a-73229511?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-10T13:14:00Z,"One in eight adults in the US have taken theweight loss drugs like Ozempic, according to survey analysis. But more than 30%of those drop the meds after just four weeks, according to a study by Blue Health Intelligence, a US healthcare data company, before the drug can have a meaningful impact on their health. Along withweight loss, Ozempic, which is also sold under the brand name Wegovy, has also won a reputation for its unpleasant side effects. The most common side effects people report are nausea, diarrhea or other digestive problems. Vision changes, erectile dysfunction and mood changes have also been reported, and you may have heard of side effect phenomena like ʺOzempic faceʺ or ʺOzempic buttʺ (sagging in all the wrong places). But what'sworrying medical professionalsmore are reports of severe medical illnesses after taking the weight loss drug, also called semaglutide or GLP-1 drugs, for several months. ʺThe most concerning side effects include pancreatitis and the effects on musculoskeletal disorders,ʺ Penny Ward, a physician-doctor at Kings College London, UK, told DW. A UK regulator has highlighted potentially deadly side effects of acute pancreatitis — an inflammation of the pancreas — after at least ten deaths were linked to this condition among British users of GLP-1 drugs. GLP-1 drugs have been on the US market since 2017. Ozempic was first approved to treat type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy was approved as a weight-loss medication in 2021. Clinical trials testing their safety and effectiveness showed them to be safe enough for their intended users. But since being release to the public, people have been reporting new side effects that hadn't appeared in the original clinical trials. Ward said it's ʺnot unusualʺ for additional adverse reactions to be noted once a product goes into clinical use. ʺRarer side effects may emerge as more patients take these medicines in clinical practice,ʺ she said, ""simply as a result of the much larger number of people treated than were included in the clinical development trials. ʺThis is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market,ʺ Ward added. A major studypublished in the journalNature Medicinein January 2025 set out to systematically analyze all the reported health risks of over 215,000 people taking GLP-1 drugs to treatdiabetes. The researchers found risks of taking GLP-1 drugs beyond those previously recognized in clinical trials, including an 11% increased risk in arthritis and a 146% increased risk of pancreatitis. Increased risks of low blood pressure, dizziness or fainting, kidney stones and kidney inflammation were also reported. The study also highlighted well-known risks of several gastrointestinal disorders, backing up numerous past studies showing an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Last year, people also started reporting that they'd gone blind after taking Wegovy. Researchers who investigated the matter found that GLP-1 drugs are associated with an increased risk of a disease affecting the optic nerve, called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). While the condition is rare, affecting an estimated 10 in 100,000 people, astudy published in the journalJAMA Ophthalmologyfound that people with diabetes taking GLP-1 drugs are four times more likely to develop NAION than the population average. ʺThis research does suggest an association between semaglutide treatment and one form of sight-threatening optic neuropathy, but this would ideally be tested in larger studies,ʺ Graham McGeown, an honorary professor of physiology at Queen's University Belfast, UK. Experts say much more research is needed in representative populations to better understand the side effects of GLP-1 drug and their real-world risks for people taking them. ʺFor example, [more data is needed about] those taking the drug for obesity, who need a higher dose compared to people with diabetes, and taking it for longer than two years,ʺ said Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist at University of Calgary, Canada. ʺBut especially, we need studies which include women. Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still [in] most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing,ʺ Skibicka added. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Despite concerns about new side effects, Skibicka told DW, ʺthe list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks. It has the promise of saving and improving many lives.ʺ As such, Skibicka said it was ʺunlikelyʺ that the appearance of rare but serious side effects would be grounds to create new, stricter recommendations for prescribing GLP-drugs. Researchers are also finding surprising 'beneficial' side effects of taking GLP-1 dugs, too. Studies show that GLP-1 drug use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs could be usedto treat substance use disorders. The January study also reported reduced risks of blood coagulation and clotting disorders, cardiorenal and metabolic disorders, and several respiratory conditions in diabetic patients taking GLP-1 drugs. The authors speculate that GLP-1 drugs might influence the risk of so many conditions for two reasons: first because they act on many parts of the body, and second because they treat obesity, which contributes to several health issues.

She experienced no sign, no overt symptoms of menopause until she did, suddenly and early, at the age of 37. ""I began experiencing excessive bleeding. I went to a doctor, who told me I might be perimenopausal,"" Kalia, who is now in her mid-40s, told DW. TheWorld Health Organizationputs the global average age for menopause at between 45 and 55 years. ""No one explained it to me. It was very sudden. I started bleeding heavily and more frequently than usual,"" Kalia said. Kalia had been using an intrauterine device (IUD) forbirth control. She had it removed, and her periods stopped altogether without explanation. Her experience was shared by other South Asian women who spoke to DW. They had their own stories to tell of how they had experienced perimenopause symptoms sooner than their global peers. A US-based study found South Asian American women reported an average menopause age of 48 or 49 years. For the general US population, the average age at which menopause begins is 52 years. In South Asia itself, the average is lower than in the US. InIndiaandPakistan, women enter menopause at around 46 to 47, and they encounter perimenopausal symptoms before that, as is common for menopause. Meanwhile, Pakistan's average number of children per woman has dropped sharply from 3.61 in 2023 to 3.19 in 2024, reflecting shifting fertility patterns. By comparison, India's rate declined more modestly from 2.14 to 2.12. Whether or how the two sets of data are connected is unclear, but there are indications that a number of factors may be coming together to affect the aging process of South Asian women.

""There's no exact rule, but studies show women tend to start and end their periods around the same age as their mothers,"" Khan told DW. ""The earlier you start menstruating, the earlier menopause is likely to occur."" Khan also highlighted a lesser-known factor: a rapid depletion of vitamin D levels among South Asian women, which can worsen chronic health issues linked to aging. Furthermore, Khan said that many women experience ovarian failure in their late 30s or 40s, often compounded by ""undiagnosed medical issues"" and a lack of quality health care earlier in life. In South Asia, and particularly in Pakistan, societal expectations push women to have children soon after marriage, often at the cost of their long-term health. ""Women's health as a distinct concern is largely ignored,"" Khan said. Awareness around hormonal health is minimal, and treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are rare. ""You'd have to pick 10,000 women to find two who've gone on [HRT]."" This intense focus on fertility often sidelines conversations about menopause and women's well-being. Sabina Qazi, a Pakistani woman in her mid-40s, based in Karachi, told DW about the emotional and cognitive challenges she faced as a cost of menopause. ""My husband and children would talk to me, but the words would just fall off in between... I had the constant need to prove that I wasn't stupid,"" she Qazi, describing the cognitive difficulties she experienced after undergoing a radical hysterectomy, a procedure in which her uterus, fallopian tubes, and both ovaries were removed due tocancer risk. Qazi said her biggest frustration with the medical process — a form of surgical menopause — was how little thought was given to the long-term consequences. Although the surgery was preventive, she felt the emotional weight of the decision was never fully acknowledged. In fact, the procedure was framed as inevitable, a foregone conclusion: She would reach menopause regardless, in a few years time, so, why not get it over with now? Qazi later began hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage her menopause symptoms. She said one of the most persistent challenges was dealing with brain fog. While her menopause followed a medically required hysterectomy, the overlap between surgical menopause and broader health risks reflects a pattern that medical consultant Khan has observed: Ovarian failure occurring in the late 30s or 40s among South Asian women, often alongside a range of chronic health conditions that appear interconnected. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The emotional toll of the surgery lingered long after Qazi's physical recovery. She received little support from her community, and peers in her close circle downplayed her experience, suggesting she needn't be concerned since she had already had three children. The cultural implication, said Qazi, was that her reproductive organs had fulfilled their purpose, and her losing her uterus and ovaries was significant. Khan said various factors appeared to be coming together to accelerate aging in South Asian women: chronic illnesses, stress and othermental healthissues, and social pressures. And each individual factor seems to be reinforcing the other. ""Brown women are too burned out,"" said Khan. ""The weight of society. The weight of mothers-in-law. Brown women end up taking on too much stress, and this makes them age faster."" Many women face relentless social expectations and little support, which intensifies both physical and emotional health challenges. One woman of South Asian descent, living in Saudi Arabia, shared: ""I feel angry all the time."" Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany"
Nearly 20% of cancer drugs defective in 4 African nations,https://www.dw.com/en/nearly-20-of-cancer-drugs-defective-in-4-african-nations/a-73062221?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-06-29T14:18:00Z,"An alarming number of people across Africa may be taking cancer drugs that don't contain the vital ingredients needed to contain or reduce their disease. It's a concerning finding with roots in a complex problem: how to regulate a range of therapeutics across the continent. A US and pan-African research group published the findings this week inThe Lancet Global Health. The researchers had collected dosage information, sometimes covertly, from a dozen hospitals and 25 pharmacies across Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Cameroon. They tested nearly 200 unique products across several brands. Around 17% — roughly one in six — were found to have incorrect active ingredient levels, including products used in major hospitals. Patients who receive insufficient dosages of these ingredients could see their tumors keep growing, and possibly even spread. Similar numbers of substandard antibiotics, antimalarial and tuberculosis drugs have beenreported in the past, but this is the first time that such a study has found high levels of falsified or defective anticancer drugs in circulation. ""I was not surprised by these results,"" said Lutz Heide, a pharmacist at the University of Tübingen in Germany who has previously worked for the Somali Health Ministry and has spent the past decade researching substandard and falsified medicines. Heide was not part of the investigative group, but said the report shed light on a problem not previously measured. ""I was delighted that, finally, someone published such a systemic report,"" he said. ""That is a first, really significant systematic study of this area."" ""There are many possible causes for bad-quality products,"" Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame in the US, the investigation's senior researcher, told DW. Those causes can include faults in the manufacturing process or product decay due to poor storage conditions. But some drugs are also counterfeit, and that increases the risk of discrepancies between what's on the product label and the actual medicine within. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Spotting substandard and falsified products can be difficult. Usually, a medical professional or patient is only able to perform a visual inspection — literally checking a label for discrepancies or pills and syringes for color differences — to spot falsified products. But that's not a reliable method. In the study, barely a quarter of the substandard products were identified through visual inspection. Laboratory testing identified the rest. Fixing the problem, Lieberman said, will require improving regulation and providing screening technologies and training where they're needed. ""If you can't test it, you can't regulate it,"" she said. ""The cancer medications are difficult to handle and analyze because they're very toxic, and so many labs don't want to do that. And that's a core problem for the sub-Saharan countries where we worked. Even though several of those countries have quite good labs, they don't have the facilities that are needed for safe handling of the chemo drugs established."" Nearly a decade ago, the World Health Organization found around one in 10 medicines used in low and middle-income countries were substandard or falsified. Independent research conducted since has backed those figures up, sometimes finding rates that are potentially twice as high. ""This could lead to treatment failure, adverse reactions, disease progression,"" health economist Sachiko Ozawa told DW. Ozawa contributed to the investigation on anticancer drugs and has separately researched other cases of defective medicines. ""For the community, there's also economic losses in terms of wasted resources,” she said. “So countries may be spending a lot of money on medications that are not going to be effective."" While high-income countries can monitor supply chains and have stringent regulatory systems in place to identify and withdraw suspect products, the infrastructure to do that is far from common in other regions. In those places, poor access to affordable medication often drives patients to less-regulated marketplaces. Inadequate governance and regulation, as well as a scarcity of surveillance and diagnostic equipment to test pharmaceuticals, are all contributing to the problem in Africa. ""In high-income countries, I think there's a much more secure supply chain where you know the manufacturers are vetted, it has to go through very stringent regulatory processes to get approval...it gets tested more frequently,"" said Ozawa. TheWHOtold DW that following the report's findings, it was working with the four affected countries to address the problem. ""We are concerned with the findings the article has highlighted. WHO is in contact with national authorities of four impacted countries and obtaining relevant data,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect to assess full information to evaluate the situation, which often takes time and capacity. But we're committed to address these issues working with the relevant countries and partners."" The WHO also reiterated its ongoing call for countries to improve their regulatory frameworks to ""prevent incidents of substandard and falsified medicines, including in settings of cancer programs.""

Stopping the manufacture and sale of those medicines is the primary preventative measure, but where defective products make it to market, surveillance and response programs can prevent poor quality medicines from reaching patients. But regulatory reform sought by experts and authorities takes time. More immediate solutions are being developed in the form of better screening technologies. Lieberman is working on a ""paper lab"" — a type of test that can be used by trained professionals to chemically test the quality of a product before it's administered to a patient. Other laboratory technologies are also under development. One comforting point is that while a significant proportion of the medication circulating in medical facilities in the four African countries was defective, the majority of the products tested met required standards. ""[With] two-thirds of the suppliers, all the products [were] good quality, so there are good quality suppliers,"" said Heide. ""But a few of them really have a suspiciously high number of failing samples."" Edited by: Derrick Williams"
Need for vigilance amid new 'Nimbus' COVID variant,https://www.dw.com/en/need-for-vigilance-amid-new-nimbus-covid-variant/a-73035887?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-06-25T13:24:00Z,"What you need to know European health authorities are warning there may be an increase inCOVID-19infections in the coming months amid the spread of the new Omicron variant NB.1.8.1. or ""Nimbus."" ""We have what feels like a fairlystandard suiteof recommendations that are being repeated,"" Ajibola Omokanye, an ECDC respiratory viruses expert, told DW. ""But we remain watchful."" The 2024-2025 winter in the Northern Hemisphere has given experts like Omokanye good reason to be watchful. Population immunity against SARS-CoV-2,the virus that causes COVID-19, is down in Europe, probably due to fewer COVID cases over the winter. As a result, Omokanye said there may be an increase in infections over the European summer. This may include severe cases that require hospital treatment. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more endemic in communities but it is ""still not a season pathogen, like influenza,"" said Omokanye. COVID still appears to move and mutate in unpredictable ways and that ""stresses the need for continued vigilance and not being complacent about SARS-CoV-2,"" said Omokanye. ""Just in the same way that we're not complacent about influenza or RSV."" Bangladeshhas already seen deaths due to COVID in June.ChinaandSingaporehave also detected new cases of the respiratorydisease. Deaths in places like Bangladesh may be partly due to people's poor access to healthcare. By comparison, Omokanye cited Canada, where Nimbus is dominant but without the same rates or severity of cases. But it's not only a case of access to healthcare. ""There are multiple factors. First, it's the timing of [a] variant's emergence,"" Omokanye said. Another, he said, is that there could be a greater possibility for waning immunity where there's been low circulation for a long period of time. With vaccination, there are also several important factors: Which vaccines are available in each country or region and ""who they are given to and when,"" said Omokanye. ""The question is: are the vaccines being taken up by that proportion of the population where you see the most severe disease?"" Similarly, with healthcare systems and access to supportive treatment, localized differences may determine how seriously infections progress in a population. ""They all contribute to the picture of severe disease,"" said Omokanye. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video ECDC and theWorld Health Organizationhave classified Nimbus as a Variant under Monitoring (VUM) due to two specific spike mutations. The spikes are the ""prongs"" that enable the virus to latch onto and infect human cells. They have regularly mutated since SARS-CoV-2 first emerged. Spike protein mutations reduce the ability of human antibodies to neutralize an infection and others that enhance the virus' ability to evade human antibodies. VUM is the lowest category in a system where the more severe stages are Variant of Interest and Variant of Concern. Edited by: Matthew Ward Agius"
DNA shows ancient Egyptians had surprising foreign roots,https://www.dw.com/en/dna-shows-ancient-egyptians-had-surprising-foreign-roots/a-73114279?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-02T15:00:00Z,"AncientEgyptwent through a period of major change between 4,500-4,800 years ago. The country's Early Dynastic period was transitioning into the Old Kingdom period. This saw advances that allowed expert builders in Cairo to construct what would become theGreat Pyramid of Giza. It also saw maturehieroglyphic writingand the emergence of the pottery wheel. South ofCairo, in a village called Nuwayrat, one man lived a hard life as a potter, even with the new technology. But, fortunately, when he died, his body was placed in a ceramic pot and buried in a tomb cut into a hillside, allowing UK-based researchers to analyze his remains, genetically. Their study,published in the journal Nature,describes the first whole ancient Egyptian genome, and the oldestDNAsample from Egypt to date. ""This individual lived and died during a critical period of change in Ancient Egypt,"" saidLinus Girdland Flink, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen, in the UK, and co-senior author on the study. Flink and colleagues have revealed how the potter lived and died, and his genetic ancestry. They know he stood 1.6 meters (5.2 feet) tall, had brown eyes and brown hair, and lived to be as old as 64 years. ""We've been able to tell part of the individual's story, finding that some of his ancestry came from the Fertile Crescent, highlighting a mixing of groups [from North Africa and the Middle East] at this time,"" said Girdland Flink. The Fertile Crescent was where the first agricultural communities of the Middle East and Mediterranean basin are thought to have settled. It was a crescent-shaped region that spanned modern-day Syria, southeastern Turkey andIraq. While it is difficult to draw broad conclusions from a single individual, ""this groundbreaking article provides a first glimpse into the genetics of early Egypt, a region that has long been acritical gap in the ancient DNA map,"" said Iosif Lazaridis, a geneticist at Harvard University in the US, who was not involved in the study. The researchers first analyzed the man's skeleton with a variety of techniques to find clues about his life. Using radiocarbon dating, they confirmed he lived at some point between 2,855-2,570 B.C., a time overlapping the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. They ran a chemical analysis of the man's teeth to learn about his diet. The results suggested the individual had likely grown up in Egypt. And markings on the skeleton itself gave clues that he could have worked as a potter. His seat bones were expanded in size, his arms showed evidence of extensive movement back and forth and there's substantialarthritis, only in his right foot. ""Though circumstantial, these clues point towards pottery, including use of a pottery wheel, which arrived in Egypt around the same time,"" saidJoel Irish, an archaeologist at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, and co-author of the study. But his higher-class burial was unusual for a potter of that time. ""Perhaps he was exceptionally skilled or successful to advance his social status,"" Irish said. Scientists have sequenced the DNA ofEgyptian mummiesbefore, but these individuals lived during the late intermediate period after 1,400 B.C. The potter is thought to be at least 1,000 years older. ""We had no ancient Egyptian DNA. This [study] is a completely new genetic analysis of someone from the old Kingdom,"" said Harald Ringbauer, a population geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who was not involved in the study. ""A major problem with previous attempts was that samples were mummified, which contaminates DNA. Here, with a normal burial, the DNA was well-preserved. This makes it special,"" Ringbauer told DW. Extracting DNA from the man's tooth, the researchers sequenced the man's whole genome. Analysis showed that 80% of his ancestry was related to ancient individuals who lived in North Africa. The remaining 20% of his ancestry was traced to people who lived in the Fertile Crescent, particularly Mesopotamia. ""It's a big open question:whenpeople with Levantine ancestry, who brought farming from the Fertile Crescent, came to Egypt. The authors speculate the Levantine ancestry came relatively late, so this study is the first major step to answering this question,"" said Ringbauer.

But researchers lack diversity in genome sequencing, and Ringbauer said that was still a problem. ""We don't have any ancient DNA to compare this sample to, so we don't know how much of their ancestry is local,"" said Ringbauer. The authors say their study shows it's possible to provide strong genetic evidence of the movements of people in Egypt during the Bronze Age. Lazaridis agreed the study marked an advance in recovering DNA from ancient Egyptians. ""For the first time, the genetic history of Ancient Egypt can truly begin to be written,"" he said. In future work, the research team hopes to build a bigger picture of migration and ancestry in collaboration with Egyptian researchers.

Heat exhaustion or heat stroke: What to do in an emergency,https://www.dw.com/en/heat-exhaustion-or-heat-stroke-what-to-do-in-an-emergency/a-66043116?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf,2025-07-01T11:40:00Z,"Sunshine at last! Time to go out to the park or lake and make the most of the nice weather. But at some point, enough is enough and our bodies need a break. If you spend too much time in the sun, you can get heat exhaustion. And those who work hard in the heat can even suffer heat stroke. The terms heat exhaustion and heat stroke are often confused. Rather than two distinct things, you can see them more as two different degrees of severity relating to your body getting hotter. How does it happen and how do you recognize both? Here are some tips for a safe summer. A lot of sun or the extreme temperatures ofheat wavescan make your body overheat and lead to heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is a heat-relatedillness, like heat rash, heat cramps or heat stroke. Although less severe than heat stroke, if not properly managed it can lead to the more serious variant. A headache is usually the first sign of heat exhaustion. You are hot, your face is red, you sweat a lot, you move more slowly, and you're likely to experience fatigue, nausea and vomiting. You might also feel dizzy or even faint. What you might not expect: The skin of someone with heat exhaustion is usually not hot, but rather cool. First of all, those suffering from heat exhaustion should immediately be taken out of the sun, to a cool place or into the shade, and drink water as quickly as possible. Cold, damp cloths can help cool the body. In addition, someone with heat exhaustion should drink plenty of fluids to bring hydration levels back to normal. Cold water or sports drinks replenish lost salts, but avoid alcohol and caffeine. These can dehydrate you even more, on top of excessive sweating, which, according to experts, can cause additional fluid loss of up to 2 liters on very hot days. Until the symptoms get better, you need to rest. It's important to know that in severe cases, severe vomiting, confusion or even unconsciousness can occur. If that happens, you should see a doctor, if only to rule out heat stroke. Heat stroke is more dangerous than heat exhaustion and may occur, for example, when you engage in physical activities in a hot environment or when heat exhaustion is not properly treated. When it's extremely hot outside, the body absorbs more heat than it can release. The body temperature can rise to 41°C (105.8°F) within 10 to 15 minutes. This acute overheating leads to an inflammatory response throughout the body. The body's temperature regulation system fails and sweat production, for example, stops. Sweating is how your body helps cool itself, so without it your body temperature starts rising. Heat stroke is life-threatening. Symptoms include impaired consciousness, headache, dizziness and drowsiness; seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and low blood pressure may also occur. Heat stroke develops within one to six hours and can cause death in less than 24 hours unless properly treated. In the elderly, chronically ill and children, heat stroke usually occurs because of a combination of high temperatures and severe fluid and electrolyte deficiencies. In healthy adults, too much physical activity in hot sunny weather, such as sports or working outdoors, is what usually causes heat stroke. At the first signs of heat stroke, emergency services should be alerted immediately. The affected person should be taken out of the sun and heat and into a cool or shady place. Their body should be cooled down as quickly as possible with cold water, ice baths or soaked clothes, and the affected person should be given fluids if possible. Excess clothing should be removed. If unconscious but breathing normally, the person should be placed in a stable horizontal position until emergency personnel arrive. Regular breathing and consciousness must be checked regularly. If the person is not breathing normally, resuscitation efforts must be started. In extremely high temperatures, our body's heat regulation system quickly reaches its limits. In addition, older people often drink too little water. As a result, the body cannot produce enough sweat, which makes it difficult for the body to cool down on its own. In many cases, it's then recommended and safest to call a doctor. The best way to avoid heat exhaustion or even heat stroke is obvious: Don't get too much sun and especially avoid it around midday; protect your head with a light-colored hat; avoid exposure to extreme heat if possible and drink plenty of fluids. As a rule of thumb, an adult needs at least half a liter of water extra on hot days. This article was originally written in German"
