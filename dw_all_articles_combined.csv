"What's behind UK foreign policy change on Palestinian state?","https://www.dw.com/en/what-s-behind-uk-foreign-policy-change-on-palestinian-state/a-73488421?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T16:56:00Z","The new direction for the UK's foreign policy regarding theMiddle Eastcame shortly after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with US President Donald Trump in Scotland. Just a day later, on July 29, Starmer interrupted his cabinet ministers' summer break for an emergency meeting, after which thepolicy turnaroundwas presented in London. In a statement, Starmer, the leader of the center-left Labour Party, said the UK could recognize Palestine as a state as soon as September unless Israel's government moved toward meeting certain conditions,including a ceasefire, not annexing the occupied West Bank and committing to a long-term peace process. Britain believes ""statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people,"" Starmer said. His government is using the recognition of a Palestinian state as a means of political pressure to push forward the so-called two-state solution. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Until now, the UK has delayed its recognition of aPalestinian statein part because of the country's own historical responsibility. Between 1920 and 1948, Britain was the administrative power in Palestine, which had previously been part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1917, the British government issued a statement — the Balfour Declaration, named after then-British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour — that said it supported the idea of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine. The declaration was made without considering the rights of the Arab majority population there and the move went on to spark violence between local Arabs, immigrant Jews and the British administration. Two years after David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, announced the establishment of the State of Israel,Britainrecognized the country. But when it came to recognizing Palestine as a state, the UK regularly said that this had to be part of a peace deal. This was also strategic: Britain didn't want to jeopardize its relationships with the US or Israel. But this historical position has come under ever more pressure. The ongoing conflict in Gaza — fighting there began in October 2023 after an attack on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, that resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 251 — has sowed serious internal divisions in the UK. In cities like London, Manchester and Glasgow, protesters regularly take to the streets in huge demonstrations calling for an end to the current conflict and Israeli occupation. These popular protests are supported by many local trade unions as well as left-leaning political organizations, such as the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the Stop the War group (the latter also opposes Europeans fighting in Ukraine). Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also called for an end to weapons deliveries to Israel. In late July, Corbyn announced he was starting his own political party ""to take on the rich and powerful."" Corbyn was suspended from the Labour Party in 2020 after he said a report intoantisemitisminside the party under his leadership had been exaggerated for ""political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media."" According to aYouGov surveyundertaken on 24-25 July, around two-thirds of Labour supporters agree with the UK government's decision to recognize Palestine. Of the general public, the YouGov poll found that 45% think it's a good idea. In the British Parliament, 221 members have signed a letter calling for recognition of Palestine. Among the signatories were many Labour Party members. Ministers in Starmer's cabinet have also pushed in this direction. Starmer appears to have given in to the pressure, at least partially. But he reiterated the UK's support for Israel and demands on Hamas in the government statement on Tuesday. ""We have been unequivocal in our condemnation of those evil attacks, and our support for the right of the State of Israel to self-defence. Hamas must immediately release all the hostages, sign up to an immediate ceasefire [...] and commit to disarmament."" At the same time though, he was critical of the Israeli government's military offensive and its policies in Gaza. ""Now, inGaza, because of a catastrophic failure of aid, we see starving babies, children too weak to stand, images that will stay with us for a lifetime. The suffering must end,"" he told journalists. While theUnited Nations and leading aid agencieshave repeatedly warned of theincreasing risk of starvationin Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there is no hunger in the enclave. The most recent figures from the health authorities in Gaza indicate that more than 60,000 people have died in Gaza as a result of the Israeli military offensive. Almost half of the dead were women and children. The Gaza health authorities are controlled by Hamas, which administers the enclave. However, thedeath toll is considered broadly reliable, including by the Israeli military, which has used the numbers in its own briefings. Israel has denied international journalists entry into Gaza since the beginning of Israel's siege, meaning DW has not been able to independently verify the death toll. A number of recent studies however,suggest it may actually be an undercount. Starmer's decision to recognize Palestine may also be a reaction to the fact that France plans to do the same during the UN General Assembly in early September. As French President Emmanuel Macron explained in Paris late last week, France wants to revitalize a peace process there and put international weight behind a two-state solution. Unlike Macron, though, Starmer is only holding out the threat of recognition if Israel fails to move toward a ceasefire. Observers have argued that it's more of a balancing act for the UK, something between taking a moral stand and taking careful account of foreign relations with the US. Trump said he and Starmer had not, in fact, discussed a Palestinian state while in Scotland. Reacting to Starmer's announcement on Tuesday, Trump said, ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position."" But later on, during his flight back to the US, Trump told reporters that Starmer was ""rewarding Hamas."" Israel's Netanyahu has described Starmer's plan as ""appeasement towards jihadist terrorists."" Currently, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state. However, what counts as a state is still disputed with different methods and prerequisites used to identify countries. Even so, several of the conditions usually accepted as necessary for a functioning state are presently not in place for Palestine. That includes a unified government, control over borders and security and clearly defined territory. In the statement announcing his government's change of course, Starmer emphasized that the Hamas group must ""accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza"" in the future.

"Trump's EPA to roll back cornerstone of climate action","https://www.dw.com/en/trump-s-epa-to-roll-back-cornerstone-of-climate-action/a-73485787?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T15:06:00Z","The administration ofUS President Donald Trumpis forging ahead with a plan torevoke a scientific finding that's long been the cornerstone of US climate action. Lee Zeldin,the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)who along with Trump has called for the ""death of the Green New Scam,"" unveiled the move at a car dealership in the US state of Indiana on Tuesday, hailing it as ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States."" At the heart of therollbackis the Obama-era 2009endangerment finding, grounded in the landmarkSupreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA. That ruling established the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants — a legal foundation for US efforts to curb emissions. If the endangerment finding is thrown out, the EPA would lose its ability to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, a move experts warn would represent a ""radical pivot in American climate and energy policy."" ""It represents a complete US step away from renewable energy and energy efficiency in favor of full embrace of expanded production and use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas,"" Barry Rabe, environmental and public policy professor at the University of Michigan, told DW. The second Trump administration is acting more aggressively in just about everything than the first, said Michael Gerrard, professor at Columbia Law School. It's closely following the blueprint ofProject 2025, a road map developed by conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. The900-page documentsuggested an ""update"" of the endangerment finding. The finding is the basis for rules regulating climate pollution established under the Obama and Biden administrations. Rules on power plants, vehicles, airplanes and landfills could now be repealed, said Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. At the same time, climate change continues to intensify across the US, fuelingextreme heat, wildfires, floods andbillion-dollar weather disasters. ""Climate change isn't going away. We are rapidly accelerating past 1.5 degrees. There will be additional public health and environmental harms that will result from that,"" said Rylander. The EPA has formally drawn up a proposal, which is now open for public comment until September. The agency will then review and respond to the feedback before issuing a final ruling, expected by the end of the year. There will then likely be lawsuits. ""Groups like mine will certainly sue,"" said Rylander. The cases will first go to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and could then be appealed to the US Supreme Court. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video It could take years for the case to reach the Supreme Court. But once the EPA issues its final decision, the endangerment finding will be revoked, Gerrard told DW. ""It stays revoked unless a court overturns it."" The endangerment finding is based on decades of scientific conclusions from credible global sources about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions onclimate changeand public health. Rylander said the EPA was ""slicing and dicing the statute to try to come up with some sort of loopholes,"" and that none of the arguments brought forward ""really passed the laugh test."" Still, with a six-to-three conservative majority, the Supreme Court has repeatedly chipped away at federal climate regulations in recent years. ""So, it is possible that the Supreme Court will uphold this,"" said Gerrard, who is also faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video One argument the agency is using to reverse the finding is that its economic and political significance is so great that it requires explicit authorization from Congress. And while the EPA under Obama and Biden assumed it was enough to show that greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans endanger the climate, the Trump administration wants to evaluate each gas individually and by sector. ""And they are saying each chunk, like carbon dioxide from US power plants alone, has to endanger the climate,"" Gerrard said, adding that this is much harder to establish. ""So, a court that is hostile to climate regulation might follow that approach and agree with the Trump EPA and say that the endangerment finding is not valid."" The EPA proposal also argues the 2009 finding failed to consider the benefits of CO2 emissions alongside their costs. Rylander called this ""a fallacious argument,"" comparing it to deciding whether a species is endangered under the Endangered Species Act. ""That's not an economic decision. It's a question of science,"" he said, adding that it's the same with pollutants, like CO2. ""Do they cause public health harm or do they not?"" Rabe said a reversal would cause ""a chilling effect on many existing federal policies for greenhouse gas emissions."" Still, the EPA would retain authority to regulate other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, mercury and coal ash from coal-fired power plants. ""And many states are working to address pollution from cars and power plants, and they would do that under state law,"" said Rylander, adding that ""US efforts to decarbonize will still continue."" However, Gerrard said, ""the best tool they have would be gone."" Edited by: Jennifer Collins"
"Bangladesh fishers risk abduction in Myanmar border tensions","https://www.dw.com/en/bangladesh-fishers-risk-abduction-in-myanmar-border-tensions/a-73485004?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T14:05:00Z","The trickling sound of the Naf River, which separates Bangladesh from Myanmar, echoes through the verdant lanes leading to Mohammad Siddiqui's hut. Just opposite his quarters in the Bangladeshi border town of Teknaf, the mountains of Rakhine state in Myanmar are visible. Siddiqui earns his livelihood as a fisherman in the river. ""I head out to fish on my wooden boat at around 7 a.m. and come back home around 1 p.m.,"" the 24-year-old told DW. ""I love it and earn between 500-600 taka ($4-$5) a month, which helps me tend to the needs of my family of eight people, including two children,"" he added. However, fishing in the Naf has now become dangerous, withthe Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in Myanmar, operating in the region. In May, a group of AA fighters abducted Siddiqui and two other fishermen. ""In early May, I went to the Naf River as I always have and hauled my fishing nets into the water. I was with two other fishermen. Suddenly, we saw the AA coming by their engine-powered boat towards us, and they fired around 20 bullets at us,"" he said. ""They had a person on their boat who spoke to me in our local language, Bengali, put a gun to my head, and asked me why we crossed into their territory. But we had not crossed Bangladesh's maritime border,"" Siddiqui said. He described how the AA handcuffed them, tied their legs, put them on their boat and took them to Rakhine state, where they were imprisoned. ""During our imprisonment, some AA members would also get drunk on wine and come and beat us,"" Siddiqui recalled. After two days, the Border Guard Bangladesh helped rescue the three fishermen following a call with the AA, and they returned to Teknaf. ""The entire incident shook me. I am suddenly scared to fish. During the time I was kidnapped, my wife cried a lot. Fishing is our source of livelihood and if I was killed, my family would struggle,"" Siddiqui said. The AA, one of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic armed groups, hasbeen fighting against the country's militarysince 2015. While there have been a couple of temporary ceasefires for humanitarian reasons or natural disasters like earthquakes, the fighting has intensified since 2023. Currently, the AA controls 14 of Rakhine state's 17 townships, as well as Paletwa Township in neighboring Chin State. In December, the AA also captured Maungdaw Township in Rakhine state, which is a key military stronghold and region in western Myanmar, bordering Bangladesh. Myanmar's military previously controlled the 270-kilometer (170-mile) maritime border between Myanmar and Bangladesh. But with the AA gaining power in Maungdaw, the control of the border fell into their hands. Since then, reports of Bangladeshi fishermen being abducted by the AA have become relatively common. Around 15 were captured and later rescued in February, and another 56 were kidnapped and rescued in March. ""These incidents are causing significant frustration for both Dhaka and the Arakan,"" Thomas Kean, senior consultant forMyanmarand Bangladesh at International Crisis Group, an NGO, told DW. ""From the AA's perspective, illegal fishermen are encroaching on their territory without permission, and they think the problem is increasing and Dhaka and the local authorities are not doing enough to prevent it,"" he said. Kean added that the AA view itself as the legitimate authority in these areas, and would contend that their actions amount to law enforcement, not abduction. ""On the other hand, it is hard for Dhaka to consider the detentions as legitimate since AA is a non-state actor,"" he said. DW reached out to the AA to understand why they are abducting Bangladeshi fishermen, but did not get a response at the time of publishing. After fishermen were abducted in March, SK Ahsan Uddin, a Bangladesh government official, told the Turkish news agency Anadolu that Bangladeshi fishermen have occasionally drifted into Myanmar's territory to fish but have been repeatedly warned against it for their own safety. Sipping on a cup of tea near the Naf, Mohammad Hussain, a fisherman who was also abducted by the AA with Siddiqui in May, said the river being closed for fishing inBangladeshhad resulted in some fishermen working very close or crossing the Myanmar maritime border. ""Fishing is our livelihood, and since there was a ban in one part of the river on Bangladeshi territory, some fishermen would cross the border. When the junta was in charge, they would question them briefly, but with AA currently in charge, it is dangerous and fishermen have been careful,"" he said. At the height of theRohingya crisisin August 2017, the Bangladeshi government banned fishing in the Naf River to prevent drug trafficking and stop the Rohingya from entering the country on fishing boats, according to local media reports. TheRohingyaare a mostly Muslim ethnic minority based in Rakhine state that were persecuted and driven out of their homes by Myanmar's military. Hundreds of thousands fled andcontinue to live in crowded campsacross the border in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's interim government lifted the ban in February, allowing fishing within Bangladesh's waters between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time. Lifting the ban brought fishermen in the area a lot of relief, but the presence of the AA across Bangladesh's maritime border with Myanmar has made them nervous and scared. ""I have been a fisherman all my life and a good catch is a win I cherish. But the AA fired at us and kidnapped us and now I am scared to fish,"" Hussain said. ""Every time we go fishing now, we recognize the sound of their boat's fuel-powered engine patrolling the border and we freeze,"" he said. Robiul Hassan, 22, who has been fishing since he was 6 years old and was also abducted by the AA in May, shares a similar fear. ""The AA is threatening our livelihood for no fault of our own, and our community does not feel safe. The village leaders have no money to buy us weapons to protect ourselves, so our families just pray for our safety when we go fishing. The government should help us out,"" he told DW. So far, the Bangladesh Coast Guard and Border Guard officials have been rescuing the fishermen abducted by the AA. DW reached out to Bangladesh's Coast Guard to understand what safety measures they are taking to help the fishermen, but did not get a response at the time of publishing. Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, an analyst at the Centre for Alternatives, a Dhaka-based think tank, said the ongoing abductions and harassment of fishermen by a non-state armed group like the AA highlight a lack of proactive measures from Bangladesh's interim government. ""It also reveals Dhaka's inability or unwillingness to pragmatically engage with a provocative foreign insurgent group, which employs gray zone warfare tactics to breach maritime boundaries, violate sovereignty and instill psychological fear,"" he told DW. ""This incident might have been acceptable if it had been isolated and exceptional. Instead, these events happen regularly, accompanied by arbitrary shootings, torture and inhumane treatment of fishermen by the AA over the past several months,"" he added. ""The AA is the de facto ruler of Rakhine and has become Bangladesh's new neighbor. It has battle-hardened troops, popular support, geostrategic depth and strong alliances with major rebel groups in Myanmar,"" he said, adding that Dhaka should begin an informal but strong understanding and engagement with the AA to ensure the safety of its people along the border. According to local media reports, Bangladeshi authorities began an unofficial engagement with the AA in December 2024. With tensions also mounting between Dhaka and Myanmar's military, Bangladesh's interim government defended this engagement with the AA and said it was a ""necessity"" in the country's interest. Rejwan said Dhaka should also involve think tanks, civil society members and local administrative representatives to foster dialogue with the AA and build mutual understanding on cross-border security issues.

"Ivory Coast's Ouattara clears path to fourth-term presidency","https://www.dw.com/en/ivory-coast-s-ouattara-clears-path-to-fourth-term-presidency/a-73478143?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T13:34:00Z","Alassane Ouattara will run fora fourth termas president ofIvory Coast, thanks largely toconstitutional changes he implemented himself in 2016which reset term limits. Nine years ago, he justified the move citing the country's ongoing ""security, economic and monetary challenges,"" which required ""experienced leadership."" Ouattara also previously said on several occasionsthat he wanted to step down from office. ""The security argument in the West African sub-region is well founded,"" said Alexander Stroh-Steckelberg, chair of the faculty of African politics and development policy at the University of Bayreuth. ""However, the security argument is not necessarily a good argument for extending the mandate,"" he told DW. Ouattara's ruling party, the Rally of Houphouetists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), has again nominated him for the top job. The 83-year-old former banker has led Ivory Coast since 2011, and claimed in a video message on his X account that both the constitution and his health allow him to serve another term. Explaining his decision to break his earlier promise not to run again, he said, ""Duty sometimes takes precedence over a promise made in good faith."" Lawyer and analyst Geoffroy Kouao told DW: ""It must be acknowledged that this outcome is not surprising, considering the party's activists unanimously endorsed Ouattara as the RHDP candidate for the 2025 presidential election. Although it still caught many people off guard."" In June, during the RHDP's second congress, party members unanimously endorsed a new candidacy for Ouattara, who also serves as the party's president. According to Sekou Dao of the RHDP political council, Ouattara's announcement is simply a positive response to the unified request from his political base. ""I always expected President Ouattara to run again,"" Dao explained. ""With only three months remaining before such a crucial election, it would be unthinkable to select a different candidate now. Doing so would even be disrespectful to the party's dedicated activists."" The opposition views Outtara's running for a fourth term as yet another breach of the Ivorian constitution, and wants to challenge it in court. ""Despite all our warnings, it is clear the president's word holds little weight,"" Damana Adia Pickass, vice president of the party led by Outtara's predecessor Laurent Gbagbo, told DW. ""The president has deceived the entire nation, which is unacceptable,"" he said, commenting on Outtara's previous promises to step down. ""We will utilize every legal avenue available to ensure the constitution is upheld."" Several opposition candidates have been barred from the upcoming election, despite a joint campaign by the biggest parties demanding their party leaders be reinstated as presidential candidates. Tidjane Thiam (PDCI-RDA) was disqualified for formerly being an Ivorian-French dual citizen, even though Thiam has renounced his French nationality. Thousands of his supporters took to the streets in Abidjan to protest against his disqualification. Andformer President Gbagbo, his former aide Charles Ble Goude and former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro have also been excluded, mainly due to legal convictions or restrictions stemming from past political conflicts. ""Today's announcement by Ouattara constitutes a violation of our Constitution and a new attack on democracy,"" said Thiam. The disqualifications have been criticized domestically and internationally as damaging to Ivorian democracy and undermining the legitimacy of the electoral process. Ouattara's announcement comes amid political polarization and legal challenges, intensifying the already fraught political landscape ahead of the October election. A planned demonstration on August 2 was also banned by the prefecture in Abidjan. ""In politics, every action provokes a reaction,"" said political analyst Kouao. ""The opposition will likely seek other lawful means to oppose what they deem a fourth term."" Since the death of the Ivory Coast's first president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in 1993, elections have historically sparked tensions. The country has yet to experience a peaceful transfer of power in 35 years of democracy. The ongoing dispute regarding the exclusion of opposition candidates is reminiscent of the violent electoral conflicts of the past, notably the 2010-2011 crisis that resulted in over 3,000 fatalities.Ouattara's contentious third-term campaignin 2020, which followed the death of his chosen successor, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, also ignited turmoil. Over 8.7 million Ivorians are registered to vote. Meanwhile, civil society organizations and religious figures, such as the Catholic Bishops' Conference, have voiced deep concern about the increasing political polarization across the nation.

K. was found guilty of participating in the execution by helping to force the pilot into a metal cage ahead of one of the militant group's most infamous murders. The conviction is the first of anyone tried over the high-profile execution. ""The investigation has shown that the defendant was at the execution site, uniformed and armed, and allowed himself to be filmed,"" Judge Anna Liljenberg Gullesjo said in a statement. Though video evidence showed another man lighting the fire that killed the pilot, the judge said K.'s involvement was decisive: ""Defendant's actions contributed so significantly to the death of the victim that he should be considered a perpetrator."" K., who wascharged in May, is already serving sentences for his role in the2015 Parisand 2016 Brussels terror attacks. He was convicted of ""serious war crimes and terrorist crimes"" for helping facilitate the execution, which was widely condemned at the time for its brutality. The pilot had been captured by IS fighters after his Royal Jordanian Air Force plane went down in Syria on December 24, 2014. He was burned alive in a cage, with the video of the killing released publicly on February 3, 2015. Liljenberg Gullesjo said K. was responsible for ""guarding the victim both before and during the execution and taking him to the cage where he was set alight while still alive."" Images of the death were disseminated online by the jihadi group.

The 32-year-old Swedish citizen Osama K. comes from the Swedish city of Malmo. Investigators were unable to work out the exact day of the murder, but the probe did identify the location where it took place. The defendant's lawyer, Petra Eklund, had argued that her client admitted to being present at the scene but disputed the allegation. K. joined IS in Syria in 2014 and later returned to Europe, prosecutors said. In 2022, he was sentenced inFranceto 30 years in prison for complicity in the November 2015 Paris attacks that left 130 dead. In 2023, he was given a life sentence inBelgiumfor his role in the 2016Brusselsattacksthat killed 32 people. France agreed on March 12 to hand over K. to Sweden for nine months to allow for investigation and trial. He will be returned to France afterward to continue serving his sentence.

The 24-year-old does, however, occasionally go to the local temple as well as gurudwara, a place of worship and assembly inSikhism. Singh also believes in astrology, and this month joined his cousins on the Kanwar Yatra, an annual pilgrimage of devotees of Lord Shiva, one of the three major Hindu deities revered inIndia. ""I am not religious, I am spiritual,"" he told DW. ""I don't go to the temple as frequently as my parents, I go sometimes for the calm and peaceful vibe. I started going when I wasunable to find a joband my mental health was at its worst."" The resident of Gurugram, a tech and finance hub just outside the capital, New Delhi, still hasn't found a job. But he says his spirituality has helped his mental health. ""A lot of my friends are like me. We just want some solace,"" he says. Interest in religion is declining worldwide.A study by Pew Research Centershowed that religious affiliation fell globally by 1% in the decade spanning 2010 to 2020. In the same period, the percentage of people who showed no religious affiliation grew from 23% to 24.2%. But in India, it's a different story. In the same Pew study, the global population of Hindus — 95% of whom live in India, where they form 80% of the population — held steady, whereas the number of Muslims, who represent more than 14% of Indians, grew. Unlike many around the world, India's youth, which makes up 65% of its population, seem to be reconnecting with religion and spirituality. But they are doing it in their own way. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video A YouGov-Mint survey showed 53% of India's Gen Z — which refers to people born roughly between 1997 and 2012 — believe religion is important and 62% of them pray regularly. An MTV Youth Study in 2021 found that 62 % of India's Gen Z believe spirituality helps them gain clarity. Almost 70% said they felt more confident after prayer. ""Gen Z has a lot of different vocabulary that they can lean on to explain what they are feeling, which is different from previous generations,"" counselling psychologist Manavi Khurana told DW. ""Terms like healing, grounding, getting in touch with the self. Spirituality, religion, wellness and well-being all get mixed up, though they have intersections as well,"" Khurana added. She is the founder of the mental health organization Karma Care in Delhi, which has a mix of Millennial (people who were born roughly between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Z clients. ""There's also a lot of people connecting to Hinduism given the current political climate,"" Khurana said. ""A lot of people find solace in religion. If they have absolutely lost hope, they find religion or some mantras or beliefs that help them find that hope. They may not have a lot of other support systems at this time,"" she explained. ""If spirituality leads to extremism, it's not the best scenario. But if someone uses it as a way to get in touch with themselves and as a coping mechanism, it is very important,"" Khurana said. Young Indians don't seem to be shying away from religion — they are reinventing and customizing it. Surya, 27, is a solo traveler and influencer with more than 290,000 followers on Instagram. Many of her trips are spiritually inclined. Surya has traveled to a number of major Hindu pilgrimage sites and festivals, including theKumbh Melain Prayagraj this year, Kedarnath and the Haridwar Kumbh in 2021. She says while social media platforms and influencers have made religion more accessible to younger generations, there's more to it than that. ""Spirituality is no longer seen as 'boring' or only for the old. It's becoming a way to find peace in a chaotic modern life,"" she told DW. ""Today's youth aren't following blindly. They're asking why, exploring how, and embracing what resonates personally. Instead of attending temples because they 'have to,' they may visit Varanasi, Rishikesh, or Isha (Foundation) to feel something real,"" she added. During an address to the parliament this year, India's Prime MinisterNarendra Modisaid that the youth are ""embracing their traditions, faith, and beliefs with pride, reflecting a strong connection to India's cultural heritage."" He was speaking before theMaha Kumbh Mela, which was held from January to February this year and saw thousands of younger attendees.

Psychologist Khurana says that while there may be an element of truth to this, that does not make the youth's relationship with religion or spirituality inauthentic. ""Just because a lot of Gen Z communicate via Instagram or the internet and that is their way of community, we can't totally write it off as performative,"" she said, pointing out that young people have been ""brought up around phones and raised by technology."" Yoga, meditation, astrology and even spiritual leaders and speakers using relatable language all appeal to the country's youth. According to a 2023 survey by OMTV, a spiritual storytelling app, 80% of Indians aged 18 to 30 engage with spiritual or religious content online. ""Gen Z's world is noisier and faster than any before. So, their entry points to spirituality look different. They may not read entire scriptures, but they'll listen to a 60-sec clip of Gita wisdom. They might not sit in a temple for hours, but they'll do a 10-minute guided meditation at night. That doesn't make it less real, just modern,"" Surya said. Edited by: Karl Sexton"
"Fact check: Aid groups contradict Israeli Gaza claims","https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-aid-groups-contradict-israeli-gaza-claims/a-73456462?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T11:46:00Z","Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuhas denied that Palestinians in Gaza are starving. ""There is no starvation in Gaza, no policy of starvation in Gaza,""Netanyahu saidon Sunday, during an event with Daystar, an evangelical TV network, held in Jerusalem. His remarks stand in stark contrast to mounting evidence from aid agencies, humanitarian organizations and eyewitnesses who describe an escalating food crisis, particularly in the north of the enclave. A DW fact check takes a closer look. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitoring body,has warnedthat famine thresholds have been surpassed in parts of Gaza, particularly in Gaza City, calling the crisis a ""worst-case scenario"" now unfolding. According tothe World Health Organization, 63 of the 74 malnutrition-related deaths recorded in Gaza this year occurred in July alone — including 38 adults and 24 children under the age of 5. Meanwhile,aid workers on the ground reportthey themselves are going hungry and Gaza's Health Ministry has said dozens of people have died from starvation-related causes over the past three weeks. With international pressure rising, BritishPrime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday the UK would officiallyrecognize a state of Palestineat the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel takes ""substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Israeli officials, however, including Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein,have rejectedthe malnutrition and starvation figures released by Gaza's health authorities and UN bodies, calling them exaggerated and unreliable. They argue that the numbers, some provided byHamas, a group designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU and others, lack credibility. However,a new independent studyhas said they are actually too low. Prime Minister Netanyahu is not alone in denying that Gaza is facing starvation. His comments have been echoed across social media by numerous online personalities and accounts that either downplay the severity of the crisis or claim reports of widespread hunger are fabricated. Israel imposed a complete blockade of food, fuel and other supplies in March and numerous politicians — including Netanyahu — have repeatedly said no food would enter Gaza.In August 2024, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said ""it might be justified and moral"" to let Israel ""cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger"" until the ""hostages are returned."" ""This is the official line repeated by the prime minister, his cabinet and the far-right media,"" Oren Persico of the Israeli independent outletThe Seventh Eyetold DW. ""They either deny that starvation is happening, blame Hamas for not surrendering or even claim it's a good thing — because it supposedly helps pave the way for building Jewish settlements in Gaza."" In recent days, several influential accounts have challenged widely shared photos of severely emaciated children in Gaza, claiming they're misleading or lack context. One image — of Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq —featured in reports by several international news outletshas also circulated widely on social media alongside posts condemning the humanitarian crisis. Pro-Israel commentators, along with Israel's Foreign Ministry, later said the boy had a rare genetic muscular disorder and alleged that omitting this detail was an attempt to defame Israel. While some posts and reports did lack that context,outlets like CNNacknowledged his condition and noted that he had been living a healthier life before the war, thanks to therapy and adequate nutrition. ""He has a muscle disorder that requires physical therapy and specialized nutrition, and he faces life-threatening malnutrition as the humanitarian situation worsens due to ongoing Israeli attacks and the blockade,"" said a photo caption. The New York Timesalso confirmedthe boy suffered from malnutrition in addition to a pre-existing illness. Still, a large number of accounts continue to circulate the claim that such photos were being misused to falsely suggest starvation — something they insist does not exist. One widely shared post (see screenshot below) reads:  ""A boy fromGazawith a rare muscular disease is being exploited to promote the fake campaign of starvation in Gaza.""DW Fact Checkidentified dozens of nearly identical posts circulating the same image and text. Our team showed the picture shared by these posts to several pediatricians in Germany to verify the claims about the child's muscular disorder. The doctors noted that the exact condition cannot be diagnosed from photos and videos alone. However, they emphasized that a pre-existing medical condition does not rule out malnutrition, and attributing all signs of emaciation solely to genetic disorders overlooks the broader impact of prolonged nutritional deficiency. For Oren Persico fromThe Seventh Eye, the accusations from the Israeli government are part of a political strategy. ""One tactic being used is to highlight non-representative examples and present them as proof that human suffering in Gaza isn't happening,"" he explained. ""It's like conspiracy theories [that] fix on irrelevant details to distort the overall picture. In that sense, I would call it a disinformation campaign—one that cherry-picks fringe facts to deny the overwhelming body of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, data and reports."" A similar narrative surfaced around a piece of video published by outlets including theThe Jerusalem Postwhich shows a close-up of a vegetable stall in a Gaza market. The footage quickly spread across social media, where it was used by accounts seeking to challenge reports of famine in the territory. ""This is footage from today at Al-Sahaba market in Gaza City, completely packed with food. So much for starvation. The average Gazan eats better than you!"",writes one account. DW Fact Check spoke with Majdi Fathi, the journalist credited with the video. He confirmed that the footage is authentic and shows a market inside Gaza, but added that it does not mean food is available for all. ""These vegetables and fruits are very expensive,"" Fathi said. ""The majority of people in Gaza cannot afford them. What Gaza lacks are other food items such as meat, milk, rice and eggs. I did not find anything else to film in the market."" Other media reports support his view. ABBC investigationfound that food packages delivered by local aid groups in Gaza often lack the nutritional variety needed for a healthy diet, leading to deficiencies and long-term health issues even when quantities are adequate. ""Until now, meat, eggs, milk, and other essentials have not entered,"" Fathi said. ""The problem is also the high prices. Since the beginning of the war, many families haven't been able to work and have no income to buy food."" On his Instagram account,he shared another video showing Palestiniansat the market complaining about the soaring cost of basic goods. Israel's recent move toallow more aid deliverieshas slightly eased prices in some areas, but the impact remains limited. While the aid is meant for free distribution, some supplies are being stored, diverted or resold. With no clear oversight by aid groups, local authorities or Israeli forces, the extent of diversion is unclear. Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed that Hamas is responsible for stealing this aid. However,The New York Timesreportsthat Israeli military officials have confirmed there is no evidence that Hamas systematically looted UN humanitarian aid, including from UN convoys. It instead alleges sporadic theft from smaller actors, not organized diversion by Hamas. Between 120 and 200 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, according to UN estimates, with an additional 260 trucks reportedly awaiting clearance as of Monday.But aid officials have described those efforts as inadequateand, in some cases, dangerous for civilians on the ground to collect them.

"Why Qatar's gas lifeline to Germany is at risk","https://www.dw.com/en/why-qatar-s-gas-lifeline-to-germany-is-at-risk/a-73460153?maca=en-rss-en-world-4025-rdf","2025-07-31T09:08:00Z","In November 2022, as Europe grappled with an escalatingenergy crisis,Germanysealed a deal withQatarto import up to 2 million tons ofliquefied natural gas(LNG) annually from the Gulf state. Theagreement, due to start in 2026, was part of Europe's broader strategy toreduce reliance on Russian gasfollowingRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nearly three years later, Qatar has threatened to halt LNG deliveries to Europe in a row over aEuropean Uniondirective aimed at improving ethical standards in global trade. German newspaperWelt am Sonntagreported last weekend (July 26/27) that Qatari authorities have written to several EU governments urging the EU to revise the directive. The letters warned that, without substantial changes, Qatar may redirect LNG exports to markets offering a ""more stable and business-friendly environment."" The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), adopted last year, orders large European firms to scrutinize their global supply chains — from raw materials to finished products — to spot and fix issues like human rights abuses or environmental harm. The directive also mandates that companies develop climate transition plans aligned with the 2015Paris Agreement. While the CSDDD has been praised by human rights and environmental advocates, it has drawn criticism from industry groups and non-EU suppliers for its high compliance costs, administrative burden and international legal scope. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Qatar has complained that the directive's climate protection rules ""go beyond the objectives and intentions"" of the Paris Agreement, adding that ""high fines, penalties, and civil liability for noncompliance"" pose a risk for state-owned QatarEnergy, the world's largest LNG producer. The CSDDD conflicts with Qatar's national energy strategy. The Gulf country's economy is deeply tied to LNG, which it sees as a ""green""transition fuelrather than a climate liability. Qatar has said it wants to make gradual, measurable progress toward carbon-neutrality, without undermining its energy exports. ""Qatar and some other oil producers and exporters have not yet put net-zero pathways in place,""Andreas Goldthau, a public policy professor at the University of Erfurt in Germany, told DW. Goldthau said this puts them at risk of EU penalties for failure to comply with the CSDDD. Under the directive, firms could face fines of up to 5% of global annual turnover if they don't carry out due diligence checks. For QatarEnergy, which reported $48.6 billion (€42.2 billion) in revenue for 2024, that could translate to a $2.43 billion penalty. Qatar has supplied 12-14% of Europe's LNG needs since Russia's war began in Ukraine in early 2022, according to data provider Kpler, sending a total of 37.1 million metric tons of the gas to the bloc. The 2022 deal with Germany is expected to further boost Europe's supply. Analysts warn that any disruption to these volumes, especially during peak winter demand, could tighten supply and trigger a renewed surge in energy prices. Thierry Bros, a professor at Sciences Po University in Paris, told DW that it was ""unsurprising"" that Qatar was now threatening supplies as ""no company"" wants to be exposed to an ""overly complex and burdensome piece of legislation."" ""Instead of entering protracted negotiations, Qatar has chosen a more assertive approach — acting early and decisively to position itself for a full exemption from the directive,"" he said. EU states were initially expected to turn the CSDDD into national legislation by next year, initially targeting firms with more than 5,000 employees and annual turnovers of over €1.5 billion. By 2029, smaller firms with head counts of 1,000 or more will be required to comply. But faced with growing pushback from the likes of Germany,FranceandItaly, as well as the finance and energy sectors, the EU has now proposed a two-year delay, until June 2028. ""The EU already relaxed some of those requirements, pushing some back into the second half of the decade,"" said Goldthau. A key legal question now looms: Can Brussels legitimately impose steep fines on non-EU firms like QatarEnergy? Experts believe practical challenges and trade implications may complicate any enforcement action. If not, the financial burden may shift to its European partners. ""Importers with legal entities within Europe could be asked to withhold payments to QatarEnergy as fines by proxy,"" Goldthau speculated. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Qatar's move may be strategically sound, but its timing has raised eyebrows. Some analysts believe Qatar is leveraging the recent US-EU trade tensions to push for an exemption. But on July 27, Brussels agreed$750 billion (€650 billion) worth of US LNG purchasesas part of thetariff dealwithUS President Donald Trump, dealing a major blow to the country's approach. ""I'm puzzled why Qatar put this forward right now,"" said Goldthau. After all, he added, Trump has just struck a deal that gives Brussels another excuse to ""pivot to the US."" But Bros sees it differently, believing Qatar's move is well timed to capitalize on Europe's lingering vulnerability from the post-Ukraine energy crisis. ""The LNG market remains tight and will likely stay that way for another three years, giving Qatar significant leverage at precisely the right moment to exert pressure,"" he said. With global LNG demand projected to rise to over 600 million tons per year by 2030, Qatar's North Field expansion and long-term contracts help position the emirate as a critical energy supplier to Europe. But if EU regulations become too burdensome, Qatar may accelerate its pivot to Asia, where demand is booming and compliance costs are much lower. Edited by: Uwe Hessler"

""We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. Pakistan said the deal will result in lower tariffs on its exports to the US. The country's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, confirmed the deal in a statement. ""Pakistan concludes deal with USA,"" he wrote on X, without elaborating further. The details of the deal — including the tariff rate agreed upon and the oil reserves Trump was referring to — were not immediately clear. Trump also made no mention of tariffs in his announcement. ""We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership,"" the US President said. In April, Pakistan was facing a potential tariff of 29% from US, which was later suspended for 90 days to make way trade negotitiations. On Thursday, Pakistan's Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb said he had conducted meetings with senior US officials in Washington, and called the deal a ""win-win"" situation for his country and the US. Aurangzeb is visiting the US capital for the second time in two weeks for what he said was a final-stage negotiation on a tariff deal. ""From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative, and its whole purpose was, and is, that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,"" he said in a video posted by Pakistan's finance ministry. The development between US and Pakistan comes less than a day after Washingtonslapped a 25% tariffon Islamabad'sarch-rivalIndia. The US imposed the tariff and other financial penalties, slated to take effect from August 1, over India's ongoing trade with Russia despite Ukraine sanctions. Trump on Wednesday criticized the Russian and Indian economies, adding that the latter had one of the ""highest"" tariffs in the world. ""I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World,"" he said. While announcing the oil partnership with Pakistan, the US President also suggested that Islamabad could sell oil to New Delhi ""some day."" ""Who knows, maybe they'll be selling Oil to India some day!"" Trump wrote.

The new levy puts South Korea on par with other US trade partners like Japan andthe European Union, which have also secured trade deals with Trumpthat set a 15% tariff rate for their exports to the US. The new rate would also apply to South Korean automotive exports. Trump touted it as a ""full and complete trade deal"" between the US and South Korea. He said Seoul had also agreed to buy $100 billion (€87.5 billion) worth of US energy products, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). ""South Korea will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. He added that an additional unspecified ""large sum of money"" will be invested in the US by Seoul. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video It was not immediately clear how the investment deals would be structured, where the financing would come from, or over what time frame. Trump said additional South Korean investments would be announced later. He added that the East Asian nation would further open up its markets to American products, including cars, trucks and agricultural goods, and impose no import duties on them. Kim Yong-beom, policy chief from the South Korean presidential office, told a briefing in Seoul that the country's rice and beef markets would not be further opened to the US due to the sensitivity of the sectors. Trump said Wednesday thatSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myungwould visit the White House ""within the next two weeks"" for bilateral talks. The meeting will be their first since Lee assumed office in June. Following Trump's tariff announcement, Lee said the agreement would put South Korea on an equal or better footing compared with other trading partners. ""We have cleared a major hurdle,"" Lee said, according to news agency Yonhap. ""Through this deal, the government has eliminated uncertainty surrounding export conditions and ensured that US tariffs on our exports are either lower than or equal to those imposed on our major trade competitors."" South Korea's opposition People Power Party (PPP), however, criticized the agreement. It said Lee's administration had rushed to clinch a tariff deal with Washington and that a lot of concessions were made. Song Eon-seok, interim leader of the PPP, called for the government to clarify if any other trade areas will be open to the US. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday also imposed a 50% tariff on most imports fromBrazil,citing a ""witch hunt"" against his ideological ally andformer President Jair Bolsonaro. The blow was, however, softened by Trump exempting some items such as aircraft and parts, aluminum, tin, wood pulp, energy products and fertilizers from the heavier duties. ""We're not facing the worst-case scenario,"" Brazilian Treasury Secretary Rogerio Ceron told reporters. ""It's a more benign outcome than it could have been."" Brazil said it remains willing to negotiate with the US on trade, but that it will not give up on tools to defend itself under national law. In a statement signed byPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian government called the use of ""political arguments"" to defend the tariffs announced by the US against Brazil ""unjustifiable."" Brazil is one of the few major economies with which the US runs a trade surplus. Last year, the US' surplus amounted to $6.8 billion on a total trade volume of $91.5 billion, US Census Bureau figures show.

It reminds us of previous disasters in Ethiopia or Biafra in the past century."" ""Worst-case scenario of famine unfolding in the Gaza Strip,"" read an alert issued by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). The UN's hunger monitoring initiative has concluded that mounting evidence shows that ""widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths."" It added: ""Latest data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Most of the more than 2 million inhabitants of the already densely populated Gaza Strip, which has a total area of 365 square kilometers (141 square miles), are currently living in extremely overcrowded refugee camps in an even more limited space because the Israeli army has declared large parts of the enclave as militarized zones. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahurecently declared there was ""no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza."" Israelhas barred international journalists from entering Gaza, and dozens of Palestinian journalists have been killed, making it extremely difficult to independently verify the situation on the ground. Since the weekend, members of the international community have been trying to find ways of alleviating the acute misery in Gaza. On Sunday,Jordanand the United Arab Emirates parachuted 25 tons of aid into Gaza. Germany and France also announced airdrop missions. ""This work may only make a small contribution to humanitarian aid, but it sends an important signal: We are here, we are in the region,"" said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Aid organizations, however, have expressed dismay. ""Using airdrops for the delivery of humanitarian aid is a futile initiative that smacks of cynicism,"" said Jean Guy Vataux, the emergency coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders (MSF). He said airdrops were ""notoriously ineffective and dangerous."" The Berlin-based Center for Humanitarian Action (CHA) called it ""the most senseless airlift ever"" as well as ""symbolic politics and a waste of money."" Its director Ralf Südhoff said airlifts were up to 35 times more expensive than land convoys. Marvin Fürderer, an emergency relief expert at the German charity Welthungerhilfe, also described the airdrops as ""symbolic"" and ""ineffective."" He told DW that one fundamental problem of the approach was that aid would be ""dropped into a high-risk environment, without coordination, without a designated drop zone and without safety structures."" He added that the aid would likely not reachthose who needed it mostbut those who were ""still mobile enough to fight their way through the rubble and crowded streets to get to a place where aid had been dropped and then to wrangle for it."" Almost every day,Palestinians are killed trying to access food at the few hubsrun by the controversialGaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The US nonprofit is backed by President Donald Trump's administration and the Israeli government, and was set up to distribute humanitarian aid after Israel banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Gaza and the otheroccupied Palestinian territoriesearlier this year. However, it has failed to provide security, with the UN accusing the Israeli military of firing on people standing in line. Earlier this week, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said ""more than 1,000 people have been killed since the end of May as they tried to get food."" International NGOshave called on Israel to allow the unhindered entry of aid into Gaza and for those organizations that used to provide supplies at around 600 distribution hubs to be permitted to resume their activities. At a press conference in Berlin, Riad Othman, a Middle East expert at the German-based human rights organization Medico International, explained that before October 7, 2023, the population of Gaza and its economy were being supplied by 500 to 600 trucks per day. ""Today, even 600 trucks a day would not be enough to meet demand because not only has the essential infrastructure and health care system been systematically destroyed in Gaza, but so too has agriculture,"" he added. A truck can typically hold about 20 tons of aid, which includes medical supplies and drinking water, as well as food. Israel has been letting some aid trucks into Gaza since Sunday, likely owing to international pressure. The Israeli military body that facilitates the entry of aid to Gaza, COGAT, said 220 aid trucks crossed into theGaza Stripon Wednesday. On October 7, 2023 the militant Palestinian organizationHamasand other groups killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in a coordinated attack. They also took 250 hostages back to Gaza.Israel launched a counterattackand declared that it would destroy Hamas. The Gaza Health Ministry has said at least 60,000 people have died in the resulting offensive, at least 147 from starvation. After violating a ceasefire agreement in March, Israel blocked all aid supplies to Gaza for more than 80 days. Now, Israel said it is observing daily pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and once again allowing aid to be delivered via land. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has criticized this decision, saying it is akin to providing life support for the enemy. Julia Duchrow, the secretary general of Amnesty International's German section, said there was ""ample evidence that Israel is using hunger as a weapon of war."" She called on the German government to stop supplying arms to Israel and to increase diplomatic pressure on the Israeli government. The Israeli government has denied many international NGOs access to Gaza. Welthungerhilfe can only provide aid via local partners, Fürderer told DW, saying that a permanent ceasefire was crucial and that the border crossings had to be opened to allow humanitarian aid in. He said that if this were to happen, Welthungerhilfe could immediately bring in aid from Jordan. ""The convoys could start within hours, as soon as the political conditions on the ground allowed,"" he said. By contrast, he said, the airdrops would call for logistical reorganization that would be costly. ""It is very interesting that this is now being considered, at a timewhen the government wants to cut humanitarian aid by 53%,"" Fürderer said. ""In a situation like this, it is difficult to spend millions on symbolic, ineffective airdrops."" The German air force already has some experience dropping aid into Gaza. In spring 2024, A400M military transport aircraft flew airdrop missions for 10 weeks, dropping 315 tons of aid supplies in total.

"Fake medication is a problem across the world","https://www.dw.com/en/fake-medication-is-a-problem-across-the-world/a-73485009?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-31T14:07:00Z","Amid rising demand for popular medications, experts and industry groups are concerned that regulators may not be able to keep pace with the speed of counterfeiters. ""A doctor simply writes down the prescription. They don't care where the patient buys the drug,"" said Saifuddin Ahmed, a public health practitioner and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US. ""It is critically important that a healthcare provider should be engaged. The [regulators are] not enough,"" Ahmed told DW. Nowhere else is the challenge more obvious than with the huge demand for products like Wegovy and Zepbound. They contain active compounds called semaglutide or tirzepatide, which were originally designed to treat type 2diabetes. But these drugs were found to have a side effect that triggeredsubstantial, sustained weight loss. Demand rose from people wanting to lose weight, and that caused a shortage. Fakes have filled the gap. Drug counterfeiting is a major global problem. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)estimates that 1 in 10 pharmaceuticals are fakes that carry no guarantee of any health benefits. While this is mainly in low-and-middle income countries, especially parts of Africa and Asia, around 1% of people in high-income nations also obtainmedicationfrom unregulated sources. In some cases, these drugs may have no effect. In other cases, however, ingredients in the fake may lead toadverse reactionsor create new health problems. ""Purchasing medicine online from unregulated, unlicensed sources can expose patients to potentially unsafe products that have not undergone appropriate evaluation or approval, or do not meet quality standards,"" said theUSregulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023, when it issued its first warnings about the problem. In 2024, the WHO issued a global warning that batches of fake Ozempic wereflooding the black market. More recently, in July 2025, data from the UK National Pharmacy Association found 1 in 5 Britons had attempted to obtain weight loss treatments in the previous year. It warned that the high demand for these medicines carried the risk that people would ""resort to unregulated online suppliers instead of regulated pharmacies."" Unregulated pharmaceuticals are being sold via online-only pharmacies, international drug shopping and organized criminal distributors. These digital marketplaces are not online stores for established pharmacies, but sites that seemingly offer medicine at a fraction of the usual cost. The drugs may look identical to genuine medicines online, but when delivered often have spelling errors on the packet or incorrect ingredient listings. But it's not only fake drugs or placebos. Regulators have raised concern about compounding, where medicines that have been approved individually can be formulated to produce non-regulated ""compounds"" for individual patients. In some regions of the world, including the US, trained pharmacists are allowed to compound medicines, but even then, the practice is less regulated than the stringent approvals that drug manufacturers must meet to bring their products to market. For example, when the FDA temporarily allowed the compounding of weight loss drugs to address a product shortage, some pharmacists used semaglutide salts — which are not approved by regulators — instead of semaglutide itself. This led to reports of side effects. And it was not just trained compounding pharmacies that were formulating these products in the US. Ahmed said, ""this is done in [places] like gymnasiums and spas."" The FDA has now stopped allowing compounded versions of these weight loss drugs, but it is concerned that unregulated online pharmacies are still making substandard products available. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video To address concerns that consumers may seek unsafe products from unregulated sources, the FDA operates a campaign calledBeSafeRxthat provides guidance for consumers to identify genuine pharmaceuticals. In the European Union, safety features on medicines are mandated, and include standardized labelling practices. In a statement provided to DW, the European Medicines Agency said ""patients should only use online retailers registered with the national competent authorities in the EU Member States, to reduce the risk of buying substandard or falsified medicines."" Europol, which is responsible for law enforcement for pharmaceutical crime across member states, has coordinated regular actions across the bloc in collaboration with US and Colombian partners. In a 2023 operation, more than 1,284 people were charged for offenses related to the trafficking of counterfeit and misused medicines and doping substances. As well as local awareness campaigns and enforcement initiatives, the key measure, Ahmed said, was to help improve awareness between patients and their health practitioners. Ahmed heads the Johns Hopkins University's BESAFE initiative, which investigates risks and interventions to prevent the uptake of substandard and counterfeit medication. Surveys undertaken by BESAFE have found that within the US and South Africa, awareness of where to safely buy prescriptions and report fakes or adverse events is low.

It's a concerning finding with roots in a complex problem: how to regulate a range of therapeutics across the continent. A US and pan-African research group published the findings this week inThe Lancet Global Health. The researchers had collected dosage information, sometimes covertly, from a dozen hospitals and 25 pharmacies across Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Cameroon. They tested nearly 200 unique products across several brands. Around 17% — roughly one in six — were found to have incorrect active ingredient levels, including products used in major hospitals. Patients who receive insufficient dosages of these ingredients could see their tumors keep growing, and possibly even spread. Similar numbers of substandard antibiotics, antimalarial and tuberculosis drugs have beenreported in the past, but this is the first time that such a study has found high levels of falsified or defective anticancer drugs in circulation. ""I was not surprised by these results,"" said Lutz Heide, a pharmacist at the University of Tübingen in Germany who has previously worked for the Somali Health Ministry and has spent the past decade researching substandard and falsified medicines. Heide was not part of the investigative group, but said the report shed light on a problem not previously measured. ""I was delighted that, finally, someone published such a systemic report,"" he said. ""That is a first, really significant systematic study of this area."" ""There are many possible causes for bad-quality products,"" Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame in the US, the investigation's senior researcher, told DW. Those causes can include faults in the manufacturing process or product decay due to poor storage conditions. But some drugs are also counterfeit, and that increases the risk of discrepancies between what's on the product label and the actual medicine within. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Spotting substandard and falsified products can be difficult. Usually, a medical professional or patient is only able to perform a visual inspection — literally checking a label for discrepancies or pills and syringes for color differences — to spot falsified products. But that's not a reliable method. In the study, barely a quarter of the substandard products were identified through visual inspection. Laboratory testing identified the rest. Fixing the problem, Lieberman said, will require improving regulation and providing screening technologies and training where they're needed. ""If you can't test it, you can't regulate it,"" she said. ""The cancer medications are difficult to handle and analyze because they're very toxic, and so many labs don't want to do that. And that's a core problem for the sub-Saharan countries where we worked. Even though several of those countries have quite good labs, they don't have the facilities that are needed for safe handling of the chemo drugs established."" Nearly a decade ago, the World Health Organization found around one in 10 medicines used in low and middle-income countries were substandard or falsified. Independent research conducted since has backed those figures up, sometimes finding rates that are potentially twice as high. ""This could lead to treatment failure, adverse reactions, disease progression,"" health economist Sachiko Ozawa told DW. Ozawa contributed to the investigation on anticancer drugs and has separately researched other cases of defective medicines. ""For the community, there's also economic losses in terms of wasted resources,” she said. “So countries may be spending a lot of money on medications that are not going to be effective."" While high-income countries can monitor supply chains and have stringent regulatory systems in place to identify and withdraw suspect products, the infrastructure to do that is far from common in other regions. In those places, poor access to affordable medication often drives patients to less-regulated marketplaces. Inadequate governance and regulation, as well as a scarcity of surveillance and diagnostic equipment to test pharmaceuticals, are all contributing to the problem in Africa. ""In high-income countries, I think there's a much more secure supply chain where you know the manufacturers are vetted, it has to go through very stringent regulatory processes to get approval...it gets tested more frequently,"" said Ozawa. TheWHOtold DW that following the report's findings, it was working with the four affected countries to address the problem. ""We are concerned with the findings the article has highlighted. WHO is in contact with national authorities of four impacted countries and obtaining relevant data,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect to assess full information to evaluate the situation, which often takes time and capacity. But we're committed to address these issues working with the relevant countries and partners."" The WHO also reiterated its ongoing call for countries to improve their regulatory frameworks to ""prevent incidents of substandard and falsified medicines, including in settings of cancer programs."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video In 2017, the WHO's review of substandard and falsified medicines offered three solutions based around prevention, detection and response. Stopping the manufacture and sale of those medicines is the primary preventative measure, but where defective products make it to market, surveillance and response programs can prevent poor quality medicines from reaching patients. But regulatory reform sought by experts and authorities takes time. More immediate solutions are being developed in the form of better screening technologies. Lieberman is working on a ""paper lab"" — a type of test that can be used by trained professionals to chemically test the quality of a product before it's administered to a patient. Other laboratory technologies are also under development. One comforting point is that while a significant proportion of the medication circulating in medical facilities in the four African countries was defective, the majority of the products tested met required standards. ""[With] two-thirds of the suppliers, all the products [were] good quality, so there are good quality suppliers,"" said Heide. ""But a few of them really have a suspiciously high number of failing samples."" Edited by: Derrick Williams"
"Late-life depression: Learn to spot the signs early","https://www.dw.com/en/late-life-depression-learn-to-spot-the-signs-early/a-73412522?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-25T13:40:00Z","It is perhaps the last place you would expect to find a generational divide, but even inmental health, we (those of us of a certain age) are told, ""We [those of us of a younger age] are more aware of mental health than you"" — as if awareness alone could remedy depression. There is actually some truth to this. ""There are shifts in younger generations and also in older generations. But unfortunately mental health is still very stigmatized for older adults,"" said Pascal Schlechter at the Institute of Psychology, University of Münster, Germany. ""It's quite a big step [for some people] to admit, 'I have a mental health problem and I want to talk about it.'"" But it's not only older patients who lack awareness or a willingness to talk about depression. It can also be their doctors, who may misdiagnose a mental health problem as a physical one, common when you grow old. ""If a 30-year-old tells you they've stopped going out and are withdrawing [from social interaction], you would ask them, 'Is anything wrong with your mental health? Are you depressed?',"" said Schlechter. ""But with an older person, you might say, 'You're fatigued. It's just part of the normal aging process. Just rest.'"" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The generational divide closes when we talk about symptoms of depression — there is little to no difference in depression between younger and older adults. While at Cambridge University in the UK,Schlechter co-published a paper on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults, based on the results from a longitudinal study that tracked the progress of more than 11,000 people over a period of 16 years. Schlechter and colleagues found the same symptoms in older adults as in younger adults: Patients expressed theyfelt depressed, or thateverything was an effort, theycouldn't get going, hadrestless sleep, or feltlonely. However, they noted: ""In older adults, depression often presents with more somatic symptoms than in younger populations."" When Schlechter spoke with DW in July, he added: ""Medical or somatic symptoms may be part of a depression, but [older adults] often misattribute these symptoms to their aging process. This can lead to delayed recognition, [and as a result] their depression may manifest more chronically."" So, there is that difference: Whether it's due to a lack of awareness among patients and physicians, or stigma,depression can be worse for older people. That may be because the depression is combined with — or, in part, ""triggered"" by — a somatic (physical) illness, or symptoms of depression were left unaddressed earlier in life — perhaps also due to a lack of awareness or stigma. As with most illnesses the earlier depression or anxiety are diagnosed, the better the chances of treating them. Some social factors also contribute to depression. As we enter late life, we are often forced to adjust to changes in our social status, our identity through work or elsewhere in a community, and people start dying around us. We may even experience abuse from our carers, as highlighted information from theWorld Health Organization on depression— another, potential contributing factor. All these things can bring what may have been a mild, latent depression to the fore in a chronic and severe way. There is a sense when talking to experts in the field that physicians may prefer to tackle physical ailments in older adults than mental ones. No matter what age a person is, depression is difficult to treat. But when older adults present with both physical and mental health problems, it's even harder. ""In both poorer and richer health systems in Europe, one of the main instruments we have to deal with depression is medication,"" said Albino Oliveira-Maia, who heads theNeuropsychiatry Unit at the Champalimaud Foundationin Lisbon, Portugal. ""When treating older adults [with] medication, [there is a] higher likelihood for interaction with other medication and for toxicities [to occur],"" Oliveira-Maia told DW. ""That might mean physicians pay more attention to physical health problems than mental health."" But medication is not the only treatment for depression — there are also a range of psychotherapy options, or so-called talk therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, and many others, specific to a patient's situation. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video One aspect of depression we have not touched on yet is suicide. Suicide can affect all groups of people, young and old, male and female. But regulation often prevents people from participating in research if they are known to have suicidal thoughts or show suicidal behavior. And that means there is a lack of understanding and knowledge among researchers. ""This is obviously an ethical concern,"" said Oliveira-Maia. ""It's an act of generosity to participate in a research program, so we need to protect the people. But in doing that, there are sometimes consequences that lead to slower progress for some of the patients that are most in need."" People over 65 years can also be excluded from trials if they have existing medical conditions, such as vascular lesions inthe brain, said Oliveira-Maia. Scientifically, this makes sense, even if only from a cold, unemotional perspective: If people die or their illnesses worsen during a trial, it can make it impossible for other teams to verify the results — which is a standard process and safety net in research, especially in the development of new medication. Both Schlechter and Oliveira-Maia have reservations about awareness campaigns, and specifically about self-diagnosis, which can go either way — a younger person may be more inclined to say, ""Yes, I have a mental health problem"" even if they don't, and an older person may deny all the signs. ""For younger generations, there is more public awareness due to social media. And there are good campaigns that provide valid information,"" said Schlechter. ""But there's also a lot of misinformation out there."" Oliveira-Maia, meanwhile, is concerned about people misdiagnosing themselves, whether they are young or old. ""While [they are] valuable, there is also some data to suggest that the awareness campaigns can in themselves lead to misclassification in that some people that are healthy can value their normal symptoms of sadness and anxiety as a mental health problem."" The solution, as always with any illness or symptom that concerns you, is to speak to a health professional you can trust. If you are suffering from emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, seek professional help.

The new species ofAcrophylla altais 40 centimeters (15.75 inches) long and weighs 44 grams (1.55 ounces), about the same as a golf ball. The new stick insect was discovered in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland, in Australia's northeast. James Cook University's Angus Emmott, who helped identify the new Acrophylla alta species, said the remote habitat was probably also why it had remained undiscovered for so long. ""Their body mass likely helps them survive the colder conditions, and that's why they've developed into this large insect over millions of years,” Emmott said in a statement. ""From what we know to date, this is Australia's heaviest insect... It's restricted to a small area of high-altitude rainforest, and it lives high in the canopy. So, unless you get a cyclone or a bird bringing one down, very few people get to see them,” he added. Scientists identified the stick insect as a new species thanks to its distinctive eggs. Two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum collection to support future research. Edited by Sean Sinico"

The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite is designed to track even the tiniest of changes in the Earth's surface. The goal of the $1.3 billion (€1.14 billion) mission is to help understand what leads to both manmade and natural disasters, such as floods, landslides and volcanic eruptions. NISAR launched at 12:10 GMT from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the southeastern coast ofIndia. ""Congratulations India!"" India's minister of science and technology, Jitendra Singh, posted on X once the satellite safely reached orbit. Now in orbit around Earth's poles, NISAR has got a busy 3 years ahead of itself. While 747 kilometers (464 miles) high, observingmelting glaciersand polar ice sheets are among the satellite's research goals.

The so-called L-band radar is provided by NASA, and the S-band radar was developed by ISRO. These radars operate around the clock to capture Earth in extreme detail and can reportedly capture measurements regardless of weather conditions. The two radars will beam signals down to Earth. When these signals bounce back, the satellite will receive them via its huge antenna reflector. Scientists will then compare the incoming and outgoing signals as the satellite passes over the same location. ""The potential applications from the satellite are huge, and the global scientific community is eagerly awaiting the satellite data,"" ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan said after the launch. ""It is not going to be used by one or two countries. The entire globe is going to benefit from this great accomplishment,"" he said.

The launch marks the biggest space collaboration between theUnited Statesand India. NASA contributed $1.2 billion for the low-frequency radar and reflector, while ISRO contributed  $91 million for the higher-frequency radar and main satellite structure.

And not just because theNeolithicsettlement was one of the oldest continually inhabited places in the world. Researchers believed that women had an elevated societal position in Catalhoyuk, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in contemporaryTurkey. But that hunch was only based on figurines they had found and believed to represent Anatolian mother goddesses. Only with the methods of modernarchaeologywere researchers able to turn their feelings into fact: Society in the Catalhoyuk of 9,000 years ago wascentered around women. An international research team led bygeneticistsfrom the Middle East Technical University inAnkarapublished theirfindings in the journalScience. The researchers came to their conclusion after examining 131 skeletons they had discovered buried right under houses the people of Catalhoyuk had inhabited. DNAanalysis showed that people buried under the same house were often related — on their mother's side. In other words, when a man and a woman entered a partnership in the Neolithic settlement, they moved in with the family of the woman, not that of the man. Households were formed on a matrilineal basis. And there was another indication that women had a higher status than men: Archaeologists found as many as five times the grave goods buried with female bodies than with male ones. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video In the more recent past, patrilineal households, where women move in with their male partner's family after marriage, were more common — and formed a patriarchy. So, does the reverse mean that the residents of Catalhoyuk, who lived from about 7100 to 6000 B.C.E., lived in a matriarchy? Not necessarily, saidprehistoric archaeologist Eva Rosenstock, who took part in the excavation in Catalhoyuk and researches scientific and cultural archaeology. ""Whether a society is matrilocal or patrilocal generally doesn't tell you anything about who has the power,"" Rosenstock told DW. ""But those things often go hand in hand."" Digging up, if you will, usableDNA for genetic analysiswas not an easy feat for the researchers. Catalhoyuk was located in a region with a continental climate, with strong fluctuations between winter and summer. Under these conditions, even teeth, which were known until recently as one of the best source ofDNA, do not keep forever. But there is a tiny part of the human body that has turned out to be the perfect source of DNA in adverse conditions such as those in the Catalhoyuk region: the petrous part of the temporal bone, located in the inner ear. ""It's like a DNA safe!"" said Rosenstock. It was through analyzing the material in this ""DNA safe"" that researchers discovered the matrilineal relationship between people buried under the same house. But not all people buried under the same house were related. The archaeologists assume that it wasn't out of the ordinary in Catalhoyuk society to switch children, so that your child would grow up in a different family close by. This was probably done in an effort to guarantee equal distribution of resources and, according to experts, points to society valuing the idea of equal rights for all. ""If your own child grows up three doors down, you're probably not going to advocate for just your household to get the best of everything,"" said Rosenstock. But how did a society valuing equality and centered on women turn into the patriarchy that has dominated Central Europe in the more recent past? Rosenstock doesn't have an answer — at least not yet: ""That's the next exciting question."" This article was originally written in German."

Would you expect your immune system to kick into action? About 250 people apparently did just that during a study conducted by scientists at the University of Lausanne and University of Geneva in Switzerland. And it appears their immune systems reacted to the mere sight ofan infection. The participants were shown artificial images — avatars — some of which had rashes, others had a cough. Some looked healthy. Bear in mind, the participants were not presented withrealsick people (a person in the same room as them), or even images of sick people butunrealimages. And their immune systems still reacted. ""We can conclude that the brain has the capacity to distinguish virtual infectious patterns, become activated, and link this activation to a downstream response, resulting in systemic immunity,"" wrote Camilla Jandus, co-author of the study paper and head of the Jandus Lab, University of Geneva, in an email to DW. Jandus and colleague Andrea Serino published their paper today in the journalNature Neuroscience. The researchers monitored participants'brain activitywhile they looked at the avatars. This allowed them to track reactions to the visuals. For example, they noticed that participants reacted stronger when a sick-looking avatar moved closer to them in the virtual reality. Jandus and Serino took this to mean the brain was sounding an alarm. The researchers checked these reactions with a ""control group"" of avatars that either stood farther or looked healthy when they appeared to approach a participant. They said this indicates how sensitivethe immune systemreacts. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video They also took blood samples from participants who had been confronted by sick-looking avatars, and those samples showed increased activity of a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Since ILCs perform a vital role in the early stages of an immune response to infection (they respond to initial signals from damaged or infected cells), the blood results suggest that the brain's reaction to the sick-looking avatars sparked an immune response. And all that before a pathogen had entered the body in reality. The team are considering various applications for their research including using VR stimuli to boost standard vaccination, to modulate immunity in people withautoimmune or inflammatory diseases, or as a non-pharmacological approach to treat people with allergies. ""This represents a therapeutic opportunity,"" said Jandus. ""We are testing this idea in allergies, such as bee and wasp allergies, whereby repetitive exposures to virtual bee or wasp stings might lead to desensitization inallergic patients."" While there is no experimental evidence to yet confirm whether there was a risk of VR stimuli leading to an overreactive immune system, Jandus said ""repetitive exposure to the stimuli, would rather result in a kind of 'tolerance.'""

"How sunscreen protects your skin","https://www.dw.com/en/how-sunscreen-protects-your-skin/a-73408932?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-27T10:40:00Z","Skin cancers, of which more than 300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, are preventable. And yet cases continue to rise, particularly in regions of the world where numbers have previously been low. As well as avoiding direct sunlight and wearing protective clothing such as hats, long-sleeved shirts and pants, effective sunscreen products have been available for years. But as genuine concerns about product safetymix with mythsand falsehoods on social media and elsewhere online, some people may move away from these cancer-preventing products. ""The most important thing that I always want to emphasize in any of the research I'm doing is the importance of using [sunscreen],"" said Richard Blackburn, a materials scientist at the University of Leeds and Keracol Limited, UK, who researches and develops new sunscreens and skin products. ""We should be worried about skin, skin damage,DNA damage, skin aging, so the use of a sunscreen, if you're going to be out, is really, really important."" Ultraviolet (UV) light is emitted bythe sun, penetrates Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface. And it's dangerous. ""UV damages all living things,"" said Antony Young, a photobiologist at Kings College London. UV is invisible but the damage it causes to humans when it's absorbed by the skin is obvious. Even a short-term exposure to sunlight — sometimes less than half an hour — can cause sunburn. There are two types of UV light: UVA and UVB. UVA is a longer wavelength form of ultraviolet and reaches deep layers of the skin. UVB usually penetrates the outer skin layers, such as the epidermis, and is the main cause of sunburn. Even people with darker skin tones need to be careful of UV. While natural pigmentation can provide a temporary guard against ultraviolet light, skin is skin, and damage can still occur after extensive exposure. In the 20th century, sunscreens were developed to reduce the harm caused by UV. They contain many ingredients but are generally divided into two categories based on their active properties. One of these are ""chemical"" sunscreens. But scientists are trying to move away from that description because, after all, everything on our planet is made of chemicals. The term they prefer is ""organic sunscreen"" because they contain carbon-based active ingredients. These molecules absorb and diminish UV rays when they hit the skin, helping to prevent sunburn. The other category is sometimes called ""physical"" or ""natural"" sunscreens. The active ingredients in these are chemicals too — but they aren't carbon-based. Instead, these use titanium or zinc oxide particles to provide a physical filter. Both sunscreens absorb and block UV from penetrating and damaging skin. The radiation is released as heat. While no sunscreen filters out 100% of UV, they are vital at blocking out an overwhelming amount of it. Sunscreens are rated using protective factor labels, abbreviated to SPF or UPF, indicating how much UV is filtered out. SPF15, for example, filters away 93% of UVB radiation; SPF30 filters 97% and SPF50 filters 98%. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Health authorities are increasingly vocal about the importance of using sunscreen, and general sun protection, to prevent skin damage and reduceskin cancer rates. But these messages are also competing with claims, including ones circulated on social media, that sunscreen can do more harm than good. Some of these arefalsehoods misrepresenting data. There are, however, also reasonable concerns about thesafety profileof some chemicals that have been used in sunscreen for years. While these have generally been considered safe, some long-approved substances like oxybenzone, avobenzone and octinoxate have been detected in the bloodstream, and may break down into toxic compounds. The question scientists — and health regulators — are asking is, are these toxins enough to pose a danger? ""What matters is the dose,"" said Young. ""This is also true with concerns aboutsunscreen pollution into the oceans. The trouble is a lot of the toxicity studies are done with doses that are not going to be achieved, or [are] very difficult to achieve."" Among other recommendations from dermatologists and researchers are for consumers to pay attention to expiry dates, storage conditions and to avoid mixing different sunscreens at the same time. That includes cosmetics that have an SPF rating. Blackburn's researchhas shown applying two different types of sunscreen products can diminish their protective benefits. ""We found it actually can reverse the whole process by combining those [different sunscreens] together, and that's very counterintuitive,"" he said. ""You would almost think you're layering and layering and you get better [protection], It's not the case."" Then there's so-called natural sunscreens that swap out certain lab-made molecules for naturally derived ingredients. Rendered beef fat, commonly called tallow, has been marketed as one such product, while some homemade recipes and online blogs point to naturally derived oils and even certain supplements to provide protection. But the SPF of these ingredients is usually negligible. Products marketed as ""natural"" will usually contain chemicals like zinc or titanium oxide to provide adequate protection. Young warns against do-it-yourself sunscreens. ""The thing about these homemade efforts is that you can't test them. Formulating a sunscreen is quite a technically tricky job to get it both cosmetically appealing, stable and also protective,"" he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video While most sunscreen chemicals, whether skin-absorbed carbon compounds or physical protectors like zinc are the current gold standard for SPF, scientists are finding new chemicals in nature. Like manypharmaceuticals, chemical compounds evolved by plants, fungi and other animals could be harnessed to provide health benefits. ""There are natural chemicals that have the potential to be protective,"" said Young. ""And plants in particular produce chemicals to protect their DNA."" Labs like those run by Blackburn are trying to identify, isolate and produce such chemical compounds for use in sunscreens. It could reduce the reliance on lab synthesized chemicals in future sunscreens, though in places like the US, these would still need regulatory approval.

"Tattoo tech may help detect drink spiking","https://www.dw.com/en/tattoo-tech-may-help-detect-drink-spiking/a-73382562?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-23T12:39:00Z","A temporary ""tattoo"" could provide partygoers looking for a safe night out with a secret indicator to detect drugs often used to spike drinks in public bars and clubs. Rohypnol — also called a ""roofie"" — and GHB, sometimes called ""liquid ecstasy"" or ""fantasy,"" areclub drugsused, often by young people, in bars andnightclubs, raves and other nightlife settings. It is an illegal drug in many places, including the United States, UK and Australia. While certain doses of these club drugs can produce a feeling of relaxation or euphoria, excessive doses can lead to symptoms of drowsiness, slurring of speech, loss of motor function, confusion and memory impairment. Overdose and toxicity are also possible. Drug regulators have also identified both drugs as the toxins of choice for offenders seeking to spike drinks, render their victims unconscious or close to that,and then sexually assault them. Because these are short-lived, tasteless and colorless drugs, it's especially difficult for those wanting to have a safe night out to know if their drink has been spiked. However, a new report published in the American Chemical Society in its journalACS Sensors,has described an innovation from aSouth Koreanresearch group that could make drug identification practically seamless. There are already products that allow people to identify whether a drink has been spiked. These appear as strips that can be dipped into a drink, with a color change indicating the presence of an unwanted chemical. However, such a technique can take minutes and could leave a person vulnerable to other social dangers with such an obvious testing method. The new rapid test developed by materials scientists funded by the South Korean government could offer an alternative. Looking like a tattoo, but in actuality a removable sticker, the new product could provide an opportunity to quickly and subtly identify the presence of GHB. Embedded in the silicone sticker film is a solution containing an iodide indicator called BHEI. When exposed to a solution containing GHB, the indicator changes from yellow to red. According to reported results, stickers changed color almost instantaneously when exposed to drops of GHB in whisky, vodka, beer or coffee. For those wearing the sticker, they would only need to expose their marker to a single droplet of their drink for the change to take place. It was sensitive enough to detect 0.01 milligrams of GHB per milliliter. ""This innovation represents a proactive and accessible solution for preventing drug-facilitated sexual assault, enhancing personal safety, and fostering a sense of control and awareness in high-risk environments,"" the authors wrote in the study.

More than a decade ago, a group from the National University of Singapore developed a fluorescent sensor platform that could be formed into drink stirrers and straws to indicate drinks spiked with GHB. A US startup had previously invented a quick test platform that tested for several drugs using a testing disc. But rapid testing products will likely need to be developed further before going to market. Kabrena Rodda, a forensic toxicologist at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in the US, said some spot tests can be unreliable. ""Unfortunately, spot detection methods such as these can often have high false positive rates — that is, telling you it detected the drug when it actually is not there,"" Rodda, who was not involved in the new study, told DW in an email. ""This can lead people to avoid drinks that may be safe, which may in turn lead to an inaccurate belief that GHB is being spiked in people's drinks."" However, Rodda said the sticker test developed by the Korean researchers was ""praiseworthy and important."" A venture company has now been established to try and bring the product to market in South Korea. But customization and adaptability to other target drugs is currently limited. ""Since a custom mold must be made and filled with agarose gel containing the GHB chemical receptor, there may be limitations in freely designing shapes like real tattoos,"" Gyeong-Ji Kim, the study's lead author based at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, told DW. ""Customization is possible to some extent, but it is technically constrained. ""We have not yet developed chemical receptors for detecting other drugs. However, if receptors for substances such as opioids or synthetic cannabinoids are developed in the future, we believe they can be integrated into our tattoo sticker platform.""

"COVID-19 pandemic sped up brain aging, says study","https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-pandemic-sped-up-brain-aging-says-study/a-73357331?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-22T21:55:00Z","A new study has found that living through the COVID-19 pandemic aged people's brains, regardless of whether people were infected. The research adds to growing data about the pandemic's long-term impact onglobal health and brain development. The study showed that the pandemic accelerated brain aging by 5.5 months on average. Changes were most noticeable in older people, men and in those from more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Brain age relates to cognitive function and can differ from a person's actual age. Someone's brain age can be delayed or advanced by diseases like diabetes, HIV and Alzheimer's disease. Premature brain aging can affect memory, sensory function and emotional function. The authors say the brain aging they observedmay be reversible. ""The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantages. We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought,"" said the study's senior author Dorothee Auer, a neuroscientist at University of Nottingham in the UK. Frank Slack, director of HMS Initiative for RNA Medicine and the Cancer Research Institute at Harvard Medical School in the US, said the ""work is a tour de force showing in a large population that COVID had severe effects onbrain health, especially in males and the elderly."" Slack was not involved in the study. The study was published inNature Communications. The study aimed to investigate the adverse effects ofCOVID-19on physical and cognitive brain aging using brain imaging and cognitive testing. The researchers analyzed brain scans from healthy adults taken before and after the pandemic as part of the UK Biobank study. ""[This] gave us a rare window to observe how major life events can affect the brain,"" said Stamatios Sotiropoulos, a neuroscientist at University of Nottingham and the study's co-lead author. First, the researchers used brain scan data from 15,334 healthy people to train a machine learning algorithm that could accurately estimate their brain age. They then used the model to predict the brain age of 996 healthy adults before and after the COVID pandemic. One group of participants had scans before and after the pandemic began, while a comparison group only had their scans taken before the outbreak. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The study revealed that the brains of participants from the pandemic group had aged an average 5.5 months faster than the control group, even when matched for a range of health markers. Jacobus Jansen, a neuroscientist at Maastricht UMC, Netherlands, said the surprising result was that ""aging is independent of actual COVID-19 infection."" However, only participants who were infected by COVID-19 showed a drop in cognitive abilities likemental flexibility and processing speed. This may suggest that the pandemic's brain aging effect without infection may not cause noticeable cognitive symptoms. The next question researchers are aiming to answer is how the pandemic had long-term effects on people's cognitive health. Other studies have suggested certain genetic factors could make some people more predisposed to COVID-related brain aging. ""[In 2022], we described premature aging in the brains of severe COVID. Unfortunately, all of the patients we examined had passed away from COVID, precluding detailed follow-up and analysis of brain architecture over time,"" Slack said. ""It will be interesting to start to ask whether the aging effects seen in this study are related to the gene expression changes we saw in our study,"" Slack said. Neuroscience studies suggest there are ways to slow down brain aging and reduce the risks of cognitive decline. Exercise, for example, is a known protective factor in brain aging, which is why ""it would be valuable to assess the contribution of changes in exercise patterns during the pandemic, alongside psychological stress, within their model,"" said Maria Mavrikaki, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. Other studies suggest that brain aging can be slowed down by lifestyle changes likeeating a healthy diet, staying physically and mentally active, managing stress and getting adequate sleep, whichpromotes healthy brain aging. These small changes can add up, so making them part of your routine can support yourbrain function in the future.

"Weight loss drugs linked with growing number of side effects","https://www.dw.com/en/weight-loss-drugs-linked-with-growing-number-of-side-effects/a-73229511?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-10T13:14:00Z","One in eight adults in the US have taken theweight loss drugs like Ozempic, according to survey analysis. But more than 30%of those drop the meds after just four weeks, according to a study by Blue Health Intelligence, a US healthcare data company, before the drug can have a meaningful impact on their health. Along withweight loss, Ozempic, which is also sold under the brand name Wegovy, has also won a reputation for its unpleasant side effects. The most common side effects people report are nausea, diarrhea or other digestive problems. Vision changes, erectile dysfunction and mood changes have also been reported, and you may have heard of side effect phenomena like ʺOzempic faceʺ or ʺOzempic buttʺ (sagging in all the wrong places). But what'sworrying medical professionalsmore are reports of severe medical illnesses after taking the weight loss drug, also called semaglutide or GLP-1 drugs, for several months. ʺThe most concerning side effects include pancreatitis and the effects on musculoskeletal disorders,ʺ Penny Ward, a physician-doctor at Kings College London, UK, told DW. A UK regulator has highlighted potentially deadly side effects of acute pancreatitis — an inflammation of the pancreas — after at least ten deaths were linked to this condition among British users of GLP-1 drugs. GLP-1 drugs have been on the US market since 2017. Ozempic was first approved to treat type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy was approved as a weight-loss medication in 2021. Clinical trials testing their safety and effectiveness showed them to be safe enough for their intended users. But since being release to the public, people have been reporting new side effects that hadn't appeared in the original clinical trials. Ward said it's ʺnot unusualʺ for additional adverse reactions to be noted once a product goes into clinical use. ʺRarer side effects may emerge as more patients take these medicines in clinical practice,ʺ she said, ""simply as a result of the much larger number of people treated than were included in the clinical development trials. ʺThis is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market,ʺ Ward added. A major studypublished in the journalNature Medicinein January 2025 set out to systematically analyze all the reported health risks of over 215,000 people taking GLP-1 drugs to treatdiabetes. The researchers found risks of taking GLP-1 drugs beyond those previously recognized in clinical trials, including an 11% increased risk in arthritis and a 146% increased risk of pancreatitis. Increased risks of low blood pressure, dizziness or fainting, kidney stones and kidney inflammation were also reported. The study also highlighted well-known risks of several gastrointestinal disorders, backing up numerous past studies showing an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Last year, people also started reporting that they'd gone blind after taking Wegovy. Researchers who investigated the matter found that GLP-1 drugs are associated with an increased risk of a disease affecting the optic nerve, called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). While the condition is rare, affecting an estimated 10 in 100,000 people, astudy published in the journalJAMA Ophthalmologyfound that people with diabetes taking GLP-1 drugs are four times more likely to develop NAION than the population average. ʺThis research does suggest an association between semaglutide treatment and one form of sight-threatening optic neuropathy, but this would ideally be tested in larger studies,ʺ Graham McGeown, an honorary professor of physiology at Queen's University Belfast, UK. Experts say much more research is needed in representative populations to better understand the side effects of GLP-1 drug and their real-world risks for people taking them. ʺFor example, [more data is needed about] those taking the drug for obesity, who need a higher dose compared to people with diabetes, and taking it for longer than two years,ʺ said Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist at University of Calgary, Canada. ʺBut especially, we need studies which include women. Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still [in] most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing,ʺ Skibicka added. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Despite concerns about new side effects, Skibicka told DW, ʺthe list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks. It has the promise of saving and improving many lives.ʺ As such, Skibicka said it was ʺunlikelyʺ that the appearance of rare but serious side effects would be grounds to create new, stricter recommendations for prescribing GLP-drugs. Researchers are also finding surprising 'beneficial' side effects of taking GLP-1 dugs, too. Studies show that GLP-1 drug use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs could be usedto treat substance use disorders. The January study also reported reduced risks of blood coagulation and clotting disorders, cardiorenal and metabolic disorders, and several respiratory conditions in diabetic patients taking GLP-1 drugs. The authors speculate that GLP-1 drugs might influence the risk of so many conditions for two reasons: first because they act on many parts of the body, and second because they treat obesity, which contributes to several health issues.

"South Asia women are aging faster than peers in Europe, US","https://www.dw.com/en/south-asia-women-are-aging-faster-than-peers-in-europe-us/a-73192160?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-08T09:22:00Z","Sumrin Kalia, a Pakistani woman living abroad, married at 18 and had four children by the time she was 25. She experienced no sign, no overt symptoms of menopause until she did, suddenly and early, at the age of 37. ""I began experiencing excessive bleeding. I went to a doctor, who told me I might be perimenopausal,"" Kalia, who is now in her mid-40s, told DW. TheWorld Health Organizationputs the global average age for menopause at between 45 and 55 years. ""No one explained it to me. It was very sudden. I started bleeding heavily and more frequently than usual,"" Kalia said. Kalia had been using an intrauterine device (IUD) forbirth control. She had it removed, and her periods stopped altogether without explanation. Her experience was shared by other South Asian women who spoke to DW. They had their own stories to tell of how they had experienced perimenopause symptoms sooner than their global peers. A US-based study found South Asian American women reported an average menopause age of 48 or 49 years. For the general US population, the average age at which menopause begins is 52 years. In South Asia itself, the average is lower than in the US. InIndiaandPakistan, women enter menopause at around 46 to 47, and they encounter perimenopausal symptoms before that, as is common for menopause. Meanwhile, Pakistan's average number of children per woman has dropped sharply from 3.61 in 2023 to 3.19 in 2024, reflecting shifting fertility patterns. By comparison, India's rate declined more modestly from 2.14 to 2.12. Whether or how the two sets of data are connected is unclear, but there are indications that a number of factors may be coming together to affect the aging process of South Asian women. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Hormonal healthexpert Palwasha Khan, a consultant physician based in Pakistan, explained that menopause timing is partly genetic. ""There's no exact rule, but studies show women tend to start and end their periods around the same age as their mothers,"" Khan told DW. ""The earlier you start menstruating, the earlier menopause is likely to occur."" Khan also highlighted a lesser-known factor: a rapid depletion of vitamin D levels among South Asian women, which can worsen chronic health issues linked to aging. Furthermore, Khan said that many women experience ovarian failure in their late 30s or 40s, often compounded by ""undiagnosed medical issues"" and a lack of quality health care earlier in life. In South Asia, and particularly in Pakistan, societal expectations push women to have children soon after marriage, often at the cost of their long-term health. ""Women's health as a distinct concern is largely ignored,"" Khan said. Awareness around hormonal health is minimal, and treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are rare. ""You'd have to pick 10,000 women to find two who've gone on [HRT]."" This intense focus on fertility often sidelines conversations about menopause and women's well-being. Sabina Qazi, a Pakistani woman in her mid-40s, based in Karachi, told DW about the emotional and cognitive challenges she faced as a cost of menopause. ""My husband and children would talk to me, but the words would just fall off in between... I had the constant need to prove that I wasn't stupid,"" she Qazi, describing the cognitive difficulties she experienced after undergoing a radical hysterectomy, a procedure in which her uterus, fallopian tubes, and both ovaries were removed due tocancer risk. Qazi said her biggest frustration with the medical process — a form of surgical menopause — was how little thought was given to the long-term consequences. Although the surgery was preventive, she felt the emotional weight of the decision was never fully acknowledged. In fact, the procedure was framed as inevitable, a foregone conclusion: She would reach menopause regardless, in a few years time, so, why not get it over with now? Qazi later began hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage her menopause symptoms. She said one of the most persistent challenges was dealing with brain fog. While her menopause followed a medically required hysterectomy, the overlap between surgical menopause and broader health risks reflects a pattern that medical consultant Khan has observed: Ovarian failure occurring in the late 30s or 40s among South Asian women, often alongside a range of chronic health conditions that appear interconnected. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video The emotional toll of the surgery lingered long after Qazi's physical recovery. She received little support from her community, and peers in her close circle downplayed her experience, suggesting she needn't be concerned since she had already had three children. The cultural implication, said Qazi, was that her reproductive organs had fulfilled their purpose, and her losing her uterus and ovaries was significant. Khan said various factors appeared to be coming together to accelerate aging in South Asian women: chronic illnesses, stress and othermental healthissues, and social pressures. And each individual factor seems to be reinforcing the other. ""Brown women are too burned out,"" said Khan. ""The weight of society. The weight of mothers-in-law. Brown women end up taking on too much stress, and this makes them age faster."" Many women face relentless social expectations and little support, which intensifies both physical and emotional health challenges. One woman of South Asian descent, living in Saudi Arabia, shared: ""I feel angry all the time."" Edited by: Zulfikar Abbany"
"Hazardous 'forever chemicals' found in period products","https://www.dw.com/en/hazardous-forever-chemicals-found-in-period-products/a-73418252?maca=en-rss-en-science-4552-rdf","2025-07-26T14:24:00Z","The name sounds almost poetic: forever chemicals. But these are perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which get their name from the fact that they practically never decompose — and stay in our environment forever. They also have serious consequences for humans. Some PFAS are carcinogenic, while others have an effect on the immune system or reduce the effectiveness of vaccinations. ""PFAS can affect fertility, sperm quality or even the development of the child in the womb,"" toxicologist Marike Kolossa-Gehring told the German TV showTagesschau. Forever chemicals have also been linked to thyroid disorders and high blood pressure. Now, a research team in the US has found thatthese chemicals can be found in reusable period products. Almost a third of the period underwear, menstrual cups and reusable pads tested by the scientists were made using these toxic chemicals. The team, led by Alyssa Wicks and Graham Peaslee at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, tested 59 reusable period products from North America, South America and Europe. The researchers found low levels in some products, which were most likely packaging residues. But in some products, the levels were so high that PFAS must have been used in the manufacturing process — even though they would work just as well without the toxic chemicals. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video ""We found PFAS in some, but not all of the products,"" Peaslee, a physicist and professor emeritus at Notre Dame University, told DW. ""So it's not necessary. Some don't have PFAS, and they sell fine."" The chemicals can harm humans in two ways. The direct route is absorption through the skin of the wearer. ""The skin absorbs between 1% and 50% of PFAS in the product,"" said Peaslee. ""Even if only 1% or 2% are absorbed, that's still bad."" The indirect route endangers not only the individual using the item, but everyone else, too. When the products are disposed of, the chemicals end up in our water cycle, where, as their name suggests, they do not decompose. People the wind up absorbing PFAS via their drinking water or food that has been irrigated with contaminated groundwater. ""These products are sold as eco-friendly, because they produce less waste than single-use products,"" said Peaslee. ""But this chemical class is particularly terrifying, because they're everywhere and don't go away."" PFAS are widespread. They are water and dirt repellent, as well as resistant to pressure and heat. This makes them attractive for companies like clothing and packaging manufacturers. Forever chemicals can be found in water-repellent jackets or shoes, in tents and in food packaging. PFAS are even used in cosmetics to alter the consistency of the product, or as a colorant, for example. With the study, Wicks, Peaslee and their team want to raise awareness of the dangers of PFAS in menstrual products, both among companies and consumers. They do not mention brand names in their published report. ""We didn't want to be sued,"" said Peaslee, adding that could easily happen in the US. The researcher said it would be more cost-effective for producers to omit PFAS from their products, as these materials are expensive. However, at the end of the day, he expects any industry move away from PFAS will primarily be driven by consumers. ""Consumers have a lot of market power,"" said Peaslee. ""Consumers should ask [whether products are manufactured without PFAS] and be vocal about their choices. If there's demand, companies will start to test for [the chemicals] and say when their products don't contain PFAS. And companies won't lie, because they don't want to get sued, either."" This article was originally written in German."
