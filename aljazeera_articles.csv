The Berlin police lied and the lie is now used to justify repression,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/15/the-berlin-police-lied-and-the-lie-is-now-used-to-justify-repression,,"On May 15, a pro-Palestinian demonstration was held in Berlin to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing and expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland. What unfolded that day was not only a case of police violence, but a coordinated effort by German authorities, the media, and politicians to turn fiction into fact in order to further criminalise Palestinian protest. According to a public statement issued by theBerlin police, a demonstrator had violently assaulted one of their officers, resulting in serious injury and hospitalisation. The police claimed the officer was dragged into the crowd, deliberately attacked, knocked to the ground, and then trampled or kicked by protesters. The message was clear: Pro-Palestinian demonstrators are violent, irrational, and dangerous. But this entire story is a lie. Video evidence, meticulously analysed byForensis, an independent research agency founded and led by members of Forensic Architecture, has unequivocally disproven every single one of the Berlin police’s claims. The footage shows an officer with the number BE24111 written on the back of his uniform jacket advancing into the crowd with colleagues to arrest a protester. As they push people around, BE24111 starts punching protesters in the head and kicking them. He appears to injure himself during this violent fit and retreats with his colleagues. There is no violent mob. No one is dragging him into the crowd. No one knocks him to the ground. No one kicks him. On the contrary, the footage shows demonstrators actively distancing themselves and shielding one another from BE24111’s assault. It was the officer, not the crowd, who carried out violence. Despite the truth being uncovered, the damage has already been done. The Berlin Police’s false narrative was quickly amplified by media outlets and government officials, unleashing a wave of fearmongering and political opportunism. A police union representative appeared on Welt TV channel and described the demonstrators as a “gang of murderers” who “would have killed the officer if they could have”. The tabloid BILD ran a headline reading: “Jew haters kick police officers”  and quoted Stephan Weh of the German Police Union as saying, “when a colleague is dragged into a crowd and trampled, losing consciousness multiple times, we have to say it’s pure luck that he survived the night […] This madness must end before one of our colleagues loses his life at such a gathering.” The Public Prosecutor’s Office stated it was “an attack on the organs of the rule of law” and launched a formal investigation into the incident under charges of “dangerous bodily harm” and a “serious breach of the peace”. The very people assaulted by police may now face criminal prosecution based on events that never happened. Germany’s Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt also seized the moment, declaring in the Bundestag: “An officer at an anti-Israel demo in Berlin was dragged into a crowd by aggressive demonstrators and seriously injured… The police need the best possible equipment and appropriate powers. We will make this clear in the law.” The state is not just spinning falsehoods; it is also bent on using them to legislate repression. This is part of its overall strategy to criminalise pro-Palestinian activism, protest and speech under the guise of fighting extremism. On June 10, less than a month after the incident, the State Office of the Protection of the Constitution, a state security agency, released its 2024 report, in which it categorised multiple pro-Palestinian organisations as “extremist” groups, including Jewish Voice for a Just Peace, BDS, and Palestine Speaks. This categorisation will likely result in more intense surveillance, potential police raids on group members, and even bans on organisational activities. Other groups have already been proscribed. In May 2024, Palestine Solidarity Duisburg association was banned and its website shut down by the Interior Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia state. Previous to that, in November 2023, the federal government banned the pro-Palestinian group, Samidoun. The state has come after not just groups but also individuals. In April, three European Union nationals and one US citizenwere threatenedwith deportation for their pro-Palestinian activism. A year earlier, Dr Ghassan Abu Sitta, a UK-based Palestinian surgeon, was barred from entering the country to speak at an event. My husband and I were placed on a black list after we were supposed to speak at the same event. For a year now, we have been subject to interrogation, harassment, and invasive searches every time we travel outside the country. Various “symbols” of pro-Palestinian solidarity have also been suppressed. The phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” was officially banned by a Berlin judge in August 2024, for allegedly expressing support for terrorism. Then, in an even more chilling move, the city of Berlin banned all Arabic-language chants at demonstrations in April of this year, effectively criminalising an entire language and silencing entire communities, particularly the Palestinian one, which is the largest in Europe. Meanwhile, police brutality at pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Germany has become disturbingly routine. Protesters are regularly kettled, beaten, and arrested without cause or explanation. What once might have seemed exceptional is now standard operating procedure. The fight to end German complicity in genocide is being violently suppressed, both in the streets and in the courts. State-sponsored censorship, racialised policing, and violent erosion of civil liberties are carried out under the false banner of public safety. While the German state continues to claim that it is “atoning for its past” by cracking down on anti-genocide protests, in Gaza, the genocide is raging at full force. Bombings continue, little children are starving to death, and aid seekers are massacred at aid distribution zones. The Israeli military is pushing forward with plans to create a large concentration camp for Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip in preparation for their ethnic cleansing. Acting to stop this horror has never been more urgent. In these dark times, those who stay silent about the German state’s lies and repression must consider carefully what they are acquiescing to. Today, it may be the pro-Palestinian activists and people of conscience who are criminalised, but tomorrow it will be others. German democracy is collapsing, and state repression will not stop at a racialised community of protesters.

Thousands of Afghans brought to UK under secret programme after data leak,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/thousands-of-afghans-brought-to-uk-under-secret-program-after-data-leak,,"The United Kingdom set up a secret plan to resettle thousands of Afghans in Britain after an official accidentally disclosed the personal details of more than 33,000 people, putting them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban, court documents have showed. A judge at London’s High Court said in a May 2024 judgement made public on Tuesday that about 20,000 people may have to be offered relocation to Britain, a move that would likely cost “several billion pounds”. Britain’s current Defence Minister John Healey told Parliament that some 4,500 affected people “are in Britain or in transit … at a cost of around 400 million pounds [$540m]” under the programme known as the Afghan Response Route. The government is also facing lawsuits from those affected by the data breach. A Ministry of Defence-commissioned review of the data breach, a summary of which was also published on Tuesday, said more than 16,000 people affected by it had been relocated to the UK as of May this year.    The breach revealed the names of Afghans who had helped British forces in Afghanistan before they withdrew from the country in chaotic circumstances in 2021. The details emerged after a legal ruling known as a superinjunction was lifted. The injunction had been granted in 2023 after the Ministry of Defence argued that a public disclosure of the breach could put people at risk of extra-judicial killing or serious violence by theTaliban. The data set contained personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to be relocated to Britain and their families. It was released in error in early 2022, before the Defence Ministry spotted the breach in August 2023, when part of the data set was published on Facebook. The former Conservative government obtained the injunction the following month. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s centre-left government, which was elected last July, launched a review into the injunction, the breach and the relocation scheme, which found that although Afghanistan remains dangerous, there was little evidence of intent by the Taliban to conduct a campaign of retribution. Healey said the Afghan Response Route has now been closed and apologised for the data breach, which “should never have happened”. About 36,000 more Afghans have been relocated to the UK under other resettlement routes. British troops were sent to Afghanistan as part of a deployment of the United States-led so-called “War on Terror” against al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US. At the peak of the operation, there were almost 10,000 British troops in the country."
Israel presses ahead with Gaza ‘concentration camp’ plans despite criticism,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/israel-presses-ahead-gaza-concentration-camp-plans-despite-criticism,,"Israel is ploughing ahead with a plan to build what critics have described as a “concentration camp” for Palestinians on the ruins of Rafah in southern Gaza, in the face of a growing backlash at home and abroad. The suggestion, first mooted by Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier this month, anticipates an area that could accommodate an initial group of some 600,000 already displaced Palestinians in Gaza, which would then be expanded to accommodate all of the enclave’s pre-war population of some 2.2 million people. It would be run by international forces and have no Hamas presence. Once inside Katz’s self-styled “humanitarian city”, Palestinians would not be allowed to leave to other areas in Gaza, but would instead be encouraged to “voluntarily emigrate” to other unspecified countries, the minister said. Katz’s plan has already received significant criticism. Labelled a “concentration camp” by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and illegal by Israeli lawyers, it has even been criticised by the military that will be responsible for implementing it, with the military’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, reportedly calling it “unworkable” with “more holes in it than cheese”. Internationally, a British minister said he was “appalled” by the plan, while Austria and Germany’s foreign ministers expressed their “concern”. The United Nations said it was “firmly against” the idea. But members of the Israeli government have defended the idea, and leaks continue to emerge in the Israeli media over the debate surrounding it within the government – with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly asking only for a plan that was speedier and less costly than a plan presented by the Israeli army. An Al Jazeera investigationhas found that Israel has recently increased the number of demolitions it is conducting in Rafah, possibly paving the way for the “humanitarian city”.    Depopulating Gaza has long been an ambition of some of Israel’s more hardline settler groups, who believe themselves to have a divine mandate to occupy the Palestinian territory. The Israeli far-right was encouraged to press ahead with the idea when United StatesPresident Donald Trump suggested in Februarythat Palestinians in Gaza could be displaced and moved elsewhere. Since then, both Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have backed calls for displacement. When Netanyahu announced in May the creation of thecontroversial US-backed GHF, a body intended to deliver limited aid into the enclave his forces had been besieging since early March, Netanyahu referred to a future “sterile zone” that Gaza’s population would be moved into, where they would be allowed aid and food. Later the same month, Smotrich, who has criticised the current plan as too costly but is not opposed to the idea in principle, also suggested that plans were under way to push Gaza’s population into a camp. Addressing a “settlement conference” in the occupied West Bank, Smotrich told his audience that what remained of Gaza would be “totally destroyed” and its population pressed into a “humanitarian zone” close to the Egyptian border, foreshadowing the language used by Katz.    Israeli political analyst Nimrod Flashenberg told Al Jazeera that – for the Israeli government – there was merit to the plan, both from a security perspective, and “from the perspective of ethnically cleansing” Gaza, and providing an end goal that Israel’s leaders could define as a success. “As I understand it, parts of the military regard removing civilians from the [non-Israeli controlled parts] of Gaza and concentrating them in a single space as an ideal first step in locating and eliminating Hamas,” Flashenberg said of the Palestinian group that Israel has failed to eliminate in 21 months of conflict, despite the killing of more than 58,000 people. Flashenberg added that the plan would effectively create an “ethnic cleansing terminal”, from which, once people were separated from their original homes, “it makes it easier to move them elsewhere”. “Of course it complicates ceasefire negotiations, but so what?” Flashenberg said, referring to the ongoing talks aimed at bringing about an initial60-day ceasefire. “Nothing has really changed. It’s possible, of course, that with work on the concentration camp under way, Hamas might still accept the ceasefire and hope that things might change.” “It’s part of their entire mentality,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a member of the Israeli parliament representing the Hadash-Ta’al party, said. “They really do believe that they can do anything: that they can move all of these people around as if they’re not even humans. Even if imprisoning just the first 600,000 people suggested by Katz is inconceivable. How can you do that without it leading to some kind of massacre?” “That they’re even talking about criminal acts without every state in the world condemning them is dangerous,” she added. But lawyers in Israel have questioned the legality of the move. Military lawyers are reported to have “raised concerns” that Israel might face accusations of forced displacement, and an open letter from a number of Israeli legal scholars is more explicit, slamming the proposal as “manifestly illegal”.    According to the United Nations, at least 1.9 million people, about 90 percent of Gaza’s pre-war population, have been displaced as a result of Israeli attacks. Many have been displaced multiple times. Earlier this month, Amnesty concluded that, despite the militarised delivery of limited aid into the strip, Israel is continuing to use starvation as a weapon of war. According to the rights agency, the malnutrition and starvation of children and families across Gaza remain widespread, with the healthcare system that might typically care for them pushed to breaking point by Israel. “Humanitarian city? I despise all these euphemisms. There’s nothing humanitarian about this. It’s utterly inhumane,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said. “There would be nothing humanitarian about the conditions that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be pushed into or about the idea you can only leave by going to another country.” “This has to be condemned and there has to be consequences,” he continued.  “It’s not true when people say there’s no international community any more. If you trade with Israel, cooperate militarily or diplomatically with it, you have leverage. The US has leverage, the EU [European Union] has leverage. All these actors do.” “By shrugging your shoulders and saying it’s just anarchy,” he concluded, “you’re handing the keys to Smotrich, Katz and Netanyahu and saying there’s nothing you can do.”"
"‘Tool of a tyrant’: Maurene Comey, ex-FBI chief’s daughter, fired by Trump",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/tool-of-a-tyrant-former-fbi-head-james-comeys-daughter-fired-by-trump,,"Maurene Comey — the daughter of James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) — has condemned President Donald Trump shortly after being fired from her role as a federal prosecutor in the United States. In a memo to colleagues obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday, Comey wrote that, if a “career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain”. “Do not let that happen,” she said. “Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought.” The memo came one day after Comey was let go from her role as an assistant US attorney in New York for the Department of Justice. The Trump administration has not yet provided a reason for Comey’s firing. But her position had long been seen as vulnerable due to her association with her father, who oversaw an investigation intoalleged collusionbetween Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race. The elder Comey was fired by Trump early in his first term, but the former FBI director has remained thesubjectof the president’s ire. Incongressional testimoniesas well as a 2018 book, James Comey has decried Trump’s “unethical” and mafia-like approach to leadership. He has also argued that Trump’s decision to fire him was an effort to undermine the Russia investigation. Since taking office for his second term, Trump and his allies have sought to purge Department of Justice employees involved in cases he disagreed with. They include prosecutors who worked on special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecutions, as he pursued two federal criminal indictments against Trump: one for withholding classified documents while out of office and the other for attempting to subvert the 2020 election. Both cases were dropped when Trump was re-elected in November 2024. It is against the Justice Department’s policies to prosecute a sitting president. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that more career prosecutors, as well as support staff, involved in Smith’s indictment had their jobs terminated.    Critics argue that the Trump administration’s decision to fire such employees has eroded the Justice Department’s independence. Many also point out that career civil servants do not choose their cases and instead serve under whichever presidential administration is in office, regardless of politics. In her message to colleagues, Maurene Comey urged her fellow prosecutors to use their current predicament to fight even more zealously for the fair and impartial rule of law. “Instead of fear,” she wrote, “let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.” “A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims. Of dedication to truth above all else.” Prior to her firing, Maurene Comey had been a veteran lawyer for the Southern District of New York, often considered one of the top prosecution offices in the country. She had most recently prosecuted Sean “Diddy” Combs, in acasethat saw the music producer found guilty on charges of transportation for the purposes of prostitution, but acquitted on charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. She had previously worked on the successful prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex-trafficking charges connected to financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls. The firing comes as Attorney General Pam Bondi faces criticism from segments of Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) base for not releasing more evidence related to Epstein, including a full accounting of his alleged “client list”. Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan detention centre in 2019.    Some influentialright-wing internet personalities, including Laura Loomer, have attacked Bondi and also called for Comey’s firing. In addition, US media outlets have reported that the Trump administration is currently investigating James Comey and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Brennan for their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. At the time, the US intelligence community concluded that Russia did seek to meddle in the election, but that there was not enough evidence to support the claim that the Trump campaign sought to collude with Russian agents. Further details of the reported probe into Comey and Brennan have not emerged."
"Cameroon’s Paul Biya, 92, says he will seek eighth presidential term",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/14/cameroons-paul-biya-92-says-he-will-seek-eighth-presidential-term,,"Cameroon’s president, Paul Biya, who is 92 years old, has announced plans to run for an eighth term in this year’s presidential election on October 12. Biya, who is the world’s oldest serving head of state, made the announcement in posts on X on Sunday in both French and English. “I am a candidate in the presidential election,” he wrote. “Rest assured that my determination to serve you matches the urgency of the challenges we face.” Biya, who is seeking a new term that could keep him in office until he is nearly 100, came to power more than four decades ago in 1982, when his predecessor, Ahmadou Ahidjo, resigned. His health is the subject of frequent speculation, most recently last year when he disappeared from public view for 42 days. His re-election bid had been widely anticipated but not formally confirmed until Sunday’s social media post. Biya had been posting regularly on his verified X handle in the buildup to the announcement.    In 2018, in a first, he also used social media to announce his candidacy for that year’s presidential contest, marking a rare direct engagement with the public on digital platforms. Members of the governing Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM) and other supporters have since last year publicly called for Biya to seek another term. But opposition parties and some civil society groups argue his long rule has stifled economic and democratic development. Two former allies have quit the governing coalition and announced plans to separately run in the election. “President Biya’s announcement to run again is a clear sign of Cameroon’s stalled political transition. After over 40 years in power, what the country needs is renewal – not repetition. Cameroonians deserve democratic change and accountable leadership,” Nkongho Felix Agbor, a human rights advocate and lawyer, told The Associated Press news agency. Sunday’s announcement is sure to revive debate over Biya’s fitness for office. He seldom makes public appearances, often delegating responsibilities to the powerful chief of staff of the president’s office. Last October, he returned to Cameroon after a 42-day absence, which had sparked speculation he was unwell. The government claimed he was fine but banned any discussion of his health, saying it was a matter of national security. Biya scrapped term limits in 2008, clearing the way for him to run indefinitely. He won the 2018 election with 71.28 percent of the vote, though opposition parties alleged widespread irregularities. The cocoa- and oil-producing Central African nation, which has had just two presidents since independence from France and the United Kingdom in the early 1960s, is likely to face a messy succession crisis if Biya were to become too ill to remain in office or die. Besides Biya, several opposition figures have also declared their intention to run, including 2018 runner-up Maurice Kamto of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Joshua Osih of the Social Democratic Front, lawyer Akere Muna and Cabral Libii of the Cameroon Party for National Reconciliation. All have criticised Biya’s long period as head of state and called for reforms to ensure a fair vote in 2025. Under Biya, Cameroon has faced economic challenges and insecurity on several fronts, including a drawn-out separatist conflict in its English-speaking regions and ongoing incursions from the Boko Haram armed group in the north."
US deports immigrants to African country of Eswatini amid rights concerns,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/us-deports-immigrants-to-african-country-of-eswatini-amid-rights-concerns,,"The government of the tiny, landlocked African country of Eswatini has confirmed that it received five individuals deported from the United States under President Donald Trump. In astatementon Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Eswatini government said the deportations were “the result of months of robust high-level engagements”. “The five prisoners are in the country and are housed in Correctional facilities within isolated units, ‘where similar offenders are kept’,” spokesperson Thabile Mdluli wrote. But she appeared to concede there were human rights concerns about accepting deported individuals whose countries of origin were not Eswatini. “As a responsible member of the global community, the Kingdom of Eswatini adheres to international agreements and diplomatic protocols regarding the repatriation of individuals, ensuring that due process and respect for human rights is followed,” Mdluli said. Her statement also indicated that Eswatini would work with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of the inmates to their countries of origin”. The deportations are part of a wider trend under the Trump administration of deporting foreign nationals to countries outside of their own. The White House has argued that these third-country deportations are necessary for individuals whose home countries will not accept them. But critics have maintained that the Trump administration is relying on countries with documented histories of human rights abuses to accept deportees, thereby subjecting them to the risk of inhumane treatment. There is also concern that deportations under Trump are happening so swiftly that those facing deportation are unable to challenge their removal in court, violating their rights to due process. On Tuesday, a spokesperson from the US Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, revealed the recent deportations to Eswatini, identifying the affected individuals as citizens of Laos, Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba and Yemen. “A safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed,” McLaughlinwroteon social media. “This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.” She asserted that the deportees had been convicted of crimes like murder, child rape and assault, calling them “depraved monsters” who had “been terrorizing American communities”. The Trump administration has likened immigration into the US to an “invasion”, and Trump himself has repeatedly tied undocumented people to criminality, though studies indicate they commit fewer crimes than US-born citizens.    Since taking office for a second term in January, Trump has embarked on a campaign of mass deportation. As part of that push, his government has deported alleged criminals to third-party countries like El Salvador and South Sudan. In March, for instance, the Trump administrationdeported an estimated 200 Venezuelansto El Salvador, where their heads were shaved and they were incarcerated in the country’s Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT), a maximum-security prison where conditions have been likened to torture. The Trump administration reportedly paid nearly $6m for El Salvador to imprison the men. Then, in May, reports emerged that the Trump administration planned to deport immigrants to Libya. A federal court quickly blocked the deportation, and government officials in Libyadenied the reports. But lawyers for the immigrants involved told US media that a flight nearly took off and was instead stalled on an airport tarmac as a result of the court order. Later that same month, a flight did leave the US with eight deportees destined forSouth Sudan, a country that the US State Department itself concedes has “significant human rights issues”. Those concerns include credible reports of extrajudicial killings, torture and “life-threatening prison conditions”. The State Department discourages travel to the country. The flight to South Sudan was ultimately diverted to Djibouti after a federal court in Massachusettsdeterminedthat the eight men on board were not given an adequate opportunity to contest their deportations. The men were from countries including Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Cuba and Vietnam. But on June 23, the US Supreme Court issued abrief, unsigned orderlifting the lower court’s ruling and allowingthe deportation to South Sudan to proceed. The Supreme Court’s three left-leaning justices, however, issued a blistering, 19-page dissent, calling the majority’s decision a “gross” abuse of the court’s power and denouncing the president’s actions as overreach. “The Government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. “There is no evidence in this case that the Government ever did determine that the countries it designated (Libya, El Salvador, and South Sudan) ‘w[ould] not torture’ the plaintiffs.”    Critics have voiced similar concerns for the immigrants sent to Eswatini, a country of 1.23 million people located northeast of South Africa. Eswatini is considered an absolute monarchy, and its leader, King Mswati III, has been accused of stamping out dissent through violence. In 2021, for instance, security forces allegedly killed dozens of protesters involved in pro-democracy demonstrations. In the aftermath, several politicians were sentenced to decades in prison for inciting violence, a charge critics say was trumped up to silence opposition voices. Still, on Wednesday, the government of Eswatini defended its commitment to human rights in its statement to the public. It also said that the decision to accept the five deportees from the US was made for the benefit of both countries. “The Kingdom of Eswatini and the United States of America have enjoyed fruitful bilateral relations spanning over five decades,” the statement said. “As such, every agreement entered into is done with meticulous care and consideration, putting the interests of both nations at the forefront.” A memo obtained by The Washington Post earlier this week signalled that Trump administration officials may knowingly be deporting individuals to countries where their human rights are not guaranteed. That memo, dated July 9, acknowledged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may remove non-citizens to third-party countries even when officials have not received credible diplomatic assurances against the use of torture or persecution, so long as certain other conditions were met. Those deportations, the memo added, could take place with as little as six hours’ notice under “exigent circumstances”."
"Suffocation, stampede, death: Tragedy at Gaza’s aid centre",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/suffocation-stampede-death-tragedy-at-gazas-aid-centre,,"Khan Younis, Gaza Strip –Eighteen-year-old Hani Hammad never imagined that his daily search for flour would end with him suffocating and being trampled. On Wednesday morning, he left his tent in the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, where he’s been displaced from Rafah along with his seven siblings, heading to a food distribution point run by the much-criticised, United States-backed GHF. “We left at dawn and stood among the thousands gathered. About 5am [02:00 GMT], they [US staff and Israeli army] signalled to open the gate, and people rushed forward,” Hani told Al Jazeera. “The gate was open, but people were packed into a very narrow corridor leading to it – only about seven metres wide,” he said, struggling to catch his breath after arriving at Nasser Hospital gasping and barely conscious. “I got in with the crowd with difficulty. Suddenly, American guards started spraying pepper spray and firing gas bombs, and people began stampeding through the corridor,” he added. “I felt like I was dying. I couldn’t move forward or backwards. I collapsed. My face and side were trampled. No one could pull me out. But God gave me a second chance,” Hani said. He was rushed unconscious to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on a tuk-tuk and initially placed beside the bodies of others who had died, some from suffocation, others from bullet wounds. “I was unconscious, couldn’t see or hear. I drifted in and out. They put me beside the dead. I thought I was one of them.” Early Wednesday,21 Palestinians were killed, including 15 by suffocation, while trying to collect food aid. The incident occurred near a gate managed by the GHF in western Khan Younis. Dozens more were reportedly injured, with some still in intensive care. Hani is the oldest of eight siblings who live next to their uncle’s tent – their parents remain in Jordan, where they travelled for medical treatment just a month before the war began. “I feel like I carry a huge burden. We’ve endured the pressures of displacement and war without our parents and without any help from them,” he said. Though he acknowledges that lining up for aid from the GHF is a major daily risk, he adds: “Our intense hunger pushes me to go every day.” “There’s no other choice. I have no money to buy the overpriced goods available in the markets. My only option is to try my luck with aid distributions,” says the young man. “Each time is a near-death experience. There’s gunfire, tanks, drones and attacks. What kind of aid distribution is this? We are exhausted, truly exhausted.” Mohammed Abedin, 24, now lies in a hospital bed with a leg wound after heading to the same aid centre in Khan Younis early Wednesday. For the first time, he says, he chose to turn back after sensing the danger of the crowd surge. The young man, a first-year accounting student, arrived about 3am (00:00 GMT) at the distribution site, but he noticed that things looked different. The same site had been closed for two days before reopening. “Before, we used to enter from several access points, and the entryway was wide. But this time, we were funnelled through one long, narrow corridor, fenced in with metal,” he says. “When the gates opened, everyone rushed forward, and people began falling underfoot.” Mohammed described a terrifying scene of people crushed against the metal barriers, screaming and gasping for help, as pepper spray and gas bombs were fired by American guards and quadcopters above. “I was standing close to my cousin, watching. We decided not to go in because of the overwhelming numbers. I saw kids screaming, choking, men and youth trapped. No one could move forward or back.” “The fenced corridor, with gas bombs raining down and people being pushed through, became a death trap,” he says. Mohammed and his cousin tried to leave, but just as he thought he had made a wise choice, a quadcoptor shot him in the leg. His cousin was also injured. “There’s always random gunfire from quadcaptors, tanks, or soldiers in the area. This time, I was the unlucky one,” he said. “But thank God, I survived.” Mohammed reflects on the tragic situation faced by Palestinians, caught between starvation and death, forced to risk their lives for food. He supports his displaced family of nine, originally from Rafah and now sheltering in al-Mawasi. “We dream daily of eating bread. I go for aid almost every day and usually return empty-handed. But the days I brought home just a few kilos of flour felt like ‘an eid’ [a celebration] for my family.” Flour is the top priority for Mohammed, especially with Gaza being under siege for four months, the borders sealed, and humanitarian and commercial goods blocked by Israel. “Bread is what drives me to risk death. There’s no alternative,” he said, awaiting surgery at Nasser Hospital to remove a bullet from his leg. “Has the world failed to provide a safe channel for aid delivery?” “There’s no system, no organised relief, no police or UN intervention. We’re shot at like animals. If we don’t die of hunger, we die in the chaos and stampedes.” In late May 2025, the GHF launched its aid distribution efforts in Gaza following an Israeli-imposed near-total blockade, which is still in effect and has prevented the entry of humanitarian supplies. According to United Nations figures,at least 798 Palestinianshave been killed since then while trying to reach or receive aid from the organisation’s distribution points. Widespread criticism has emerged from UN agencies and rights organisations that argue the operation is politicised and endangers civilians. The UN has stated that the GHF’s operations violate humanitarian neutrality and are inherently unsafe, highlighted by the hundreds of deaths at their sites. Ziad Masad Mansour, 43, displaced with his wife and six children from central Gaza to al-Mawasi in Khan Younis after their home was destroyed in the war, is another frequent visitor to the aid lines. “I head there at 10 at night and sleep on the sand like thousands of others. We endure the dust and humiliation,” said Mansour, who was wounded in the head on Wednesday. “Sometimes I manage to get flour, sometimes a few cans. Other times, I return empty-handed. I even help others carry their bags in exchange for some food.” “Yesterday, there was horrific crowding: gas bombs, bullets, and we were packed tightly in the narrow corridor. I was trying to escape the crush when I got shot in the head and lost consciousness.” Mansour is now recovering at Nasser Hospital. “More than 20 people died today – for a bag of flour. What more is there to say?”"
"Europe assumes financial burden of Ukraine war, angering Russia",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/europe-assumes-financial-burden-of-ukraine-war-alarming-russia,,"The United States and Germany have struck a deal to provide Ukraine with weaponry to protect cities fromnightlyRussian attacks. Germany was prepared to pay for the systems as part of a broader US deal to sell Europe arms destined for Ukraine. Details began to emerge on July 10 when Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Germany would buy US-madeair defence systems. “We are also prepared to purchase additionalPatriot systemsfrom the US to make them available to Ukraine,” Merz was quoted as saying on the sidelines of a Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome. On Friday, US President Donald Trump told NBC News that the US would sell NATO US-made weapons, including the Patriots, that NATO would give to Ukraine. Adding to the crescendo, US Senator Lindsey Graham told CBS on Sunday: “In the coming days, you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves.” Meanwhile, Russia continued to capture Ukrainian villages. On Friday, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have seized Zelyonaya Dolina in the eastern region of Donetsk and Sobolevka in Kharkiv in the northeast. Nikolayevka in Donetsk fell on Sunday, Malinovka in Zaporizhia on Monday and Novokhatskoye in Donetsk on Wednesday. Yet even at this accelerated rate of 15sq km (6sq miles) a day, Russia would need 89 years to capture the rest of Ukraine, The Economist magazine estimated. Russia continued to pound Ukraine’s cities with combinations of drones and missiles every night over the past week. The biggest attack came early on Saturday. The Ukrainian air force said it downed or electronically suppressed 577 of 597 drones launched overnight and 25 of 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles. June also saw the highest monthly civilian casualties in three years with 232 people killed and 1,343 injured, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said. Trump announced on Monday at the White House that he had approved $10bn in weapons sales to Ukraine, which were to be paid for by Ukraine’s European allies. “We’ve made a deal today where we’re going to be sending them weapons and they’re going to be paying for them,” he said. He doubled down on that financial message, telling reporters on Tuesday that after spending billions to help Ukraine, “we’re getting our money back in full.” Graham played on the same theme. “Stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine,” he told CBS. Trump said he would send 17 Patriot systems to Ukraine. It was not clear if this meant 17 batteries or 17 launchers. “It’s everything. It’s Patriots. It’s all of them. It’s a full complement with the batteries,” Trump said. A Patriot battery usually contains six launchers, each typically carrying four missiles. The particulars of the deal have remained murky and perhaps deliberately so. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who was in Washington, DC, on Monday, didn’t disclose details. “But one thing is clear – and this is a message to all other European NATO members: Everyone must open their wallets. It’s about urgently raising the funds needed, especially for air defence, because Ukraine is under enormous pressure,” Pistorius said. Russia has increased its attacks on Ukraine’s cities since the beginning of the year. In June alone, Moscow launched 330 missiles and 5,000 drones against Ukraine. While Patriots are too expensive to use on drones, they are the only weapon in Ukraine that can shoot down ballistic missiles and are also effective against cruise missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in April that Ukraine needed 10 more Patriot systems to protect its cities – presumably referring to complete batteries. Germany’s head of defence planning, Major General Christian Freuding, said on Saturday that Pistorius and his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, had discussed a German offer to buy two Patriot systems for Ukraine. It was not clear if Pistorius’s visit to Washington, DC, was related to that. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters the Patriot systems were “already being shipped, … coming in from Germany”. Separately, Zelenskyy told Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, when they met in Kyiv on Monday that Ukraine was ready “to purchase American weapons, particularly air defence systems”. Moscow has balked at the Western deal for Ukraine. “Mr Merz is a fierce proponent of confrontation on all fronts and of aggressively mobilising Europe,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Germany, France and the United Kingdom were “attempting to raise Europe for war, … a direct war against Russia”. Trump also announced possible secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil. “We are very, very unhappy with Russia – I am,” he said Monday in the White House while sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. “I am disappointed in President [Vladimir] Putin because I thought we would have a deal two months ago.”  Trump said he was putting Putin on 50 days notice. “We’re going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days. It’s very simple. And they’ll be at 100 percent.” The tariffs would be levied on goods the US imports from countries that buy Russian oil, an idea Graham has aggressively pursued in recent weeks, naming China, India and Brazil as the worst offenders. “We would like to understand what is behind this statement about 50 days,” Lavrov said. “Earlier, there were also the deadlines of 24 hours and of 100 days. We’ve seen it all and really would like to understand the motivation of the US president.” Lavrov was referring to Trump’s campaign boast that he would end the war in Ukraine in a day and Kellogg’s self-imposed 100-day goal to bring about a ceasefire. Some observers are sceptical about whether Trump will get tough on Putin, whom he has openly admired. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, shrugged off Trump’s remarks. “Trump issued a theatrical ultimatum to the Kremlin. The world shuddered, expecting the consequences. Belligerent Europe was disappointed. Russia didn’t care,” he wrote on social media. But Peskov on Tuesday called Trump’s remarks “very serious”, adding: “Something in them concerns President Putin personally.” On Wednesday, the normally restrained Peskov sounded even more alarmed that Europe was now willing to foot the bill for the war without US assistance. “What we are observing so far is that the Europeans are displaying a completely aggressive militarist stance, declaring their intention to spend enormous funds to purchase weapons, to further provoke the continuation of war,” Peskov said. “Of course, it is very hard to predict anything amid such an emotional state, bordering on irrationality, which reigns on the European continent,” he added.    The only thing that assuaged Russian concerns was indecision over sending Ukraine Germany’s Taurus missiles, which can strike deep inside Russia with large warheads. That news suggested that Europeans “still have some sense of reason left”, Peskov said on Wednesday. Europe’s willingness to spend on defence may also have brought forth the dawn of more independence from the US. Last week, the UK and France announced a scaling-up of their Combined Joint Force to a corps level, a reorientation of that force from overseas expeditions, “refocusing it on defending Europe” and upgrading it “to war-fighting readiness”. They announced new procurement of Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles and joint research on a generation of missiles that would “harness the power of AI”. They also issued the Northwood Declaration on closer nuclear coordination. “Any adversary threatening the vital interests of Britain or France could be confronted by the strength of the nuclear forces of both nations,” the UK Ministry of Defence said. France and Britain are the only European states with a nuclear deterrent. The US Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, approved $500m in security assistance for Ukraine as part of its draft language for the next fiscal year – the only military aid announced under the Trump administration. Under former President Joe Biden, the US spent $64.6bn on military aid to Ukraine, according to a tracker run by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Biden also left $4bn unspent in the form of a presidential authority to draw down weapons from US stockpiles and send them to Ukraine. Trump has not exercised that authority, insisting that the US needs to be paid back. As Trump touted $10bn in weapons sales, the European Commission announced 10 billion euros ($11.6bn) in investments in Ukraine, leveraged through 2.3 billion euros ($2.7bn) in loans and grants from European institutions. The announcement came at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. The money is for rebuilding critical infrastructure and networks and helping small businesses. “We need a Marshall Plan-style approach,” Zelenskyy declared upon arrival in Rome, referring to the post-World War II system of grants from the US that rebuilt the European economy."

Israel is killing doctors so Gaza can never heal from genocide,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/9/israel-is-killing-doctors-so-gaza-can-never-heal-from-genocide,,"After her parents, sister and husband were killed in a bombing, Lubnah prayed they would be the last victims of the war. Her father, Dr Marwan al-Sultan, was one of Gaza’s most respected medics, director of the Indonesian Hospital, and one of only two surviving cardiologists in the Strip. On July 2, an Israeli bomb killed him, alongside his wife Dhikra, their daughter Lamees, his sister Amneh, and his son-in-law Mohammed, Lubnah’s husband. The family had been sheltering in an apartment, in an area designated by Israel as “safe”, having evacuated their home in Jabalia in compliance with orders from the Israeli occupation forces (IOF). The so-called “Chalet area” of western Gaza City was once a place where families spent time at the beach, enjoying themselves, despite the daily trials of Israeli occupation. The bomb targeted directly the room Dr Marwan was sitting in; no other part of the building was destroyed. Lubnah survived because she had gone downstairs to prepare food. Her brothers, Omar, Ahmad and Nimr also survived because they were outside the home. The day before his death, upon hearing the news of a possible ceasefire, Dr Marwan shared a hopeful vision with his son, Omar. “The first thing we’ll do [once a ceasefire is reached] is go back home. With everyone’s effort, in a month or two, we can make it as before. Then we’ll rebuild the hospital,” he said. Omar felt inspired by his father. Dr Marwan’s dreams were buried with him. His daughter Lubnah’s prayers were not answered. The genocide continued taking victims. On July 4, another doctor was murdered: Dr Musa Hamdan Khafaja – a consultant in obstetrics and gynecology in Nasser Hospital. The attack was eerily similar. Dr Musa had also followed the orders of the IOF, fled his home in Khan Younis, and sought refuge in al-Mawasi, another “safe zone”. There, he pitched a tent to shelter his family. That tent became their grave. His wife and three young children – daughters Shaza and Judi, and son Adel, all died. The only survivor was his son Amr. Both men had dedicated their careers to saving the lives of others, staying with their patients through bombings and sieges on their hospitals. Dr Marwan was the 70th healthcare worker killed in the previous 50 days; Dr Musa became the 71st. Their deaths bring the total number of medical personnel killed since October 2023 to at least 1,580, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza. Every two days since the war began, Israel has killed five medical personnel, that is 16 doctors, nurses, ambulance technicians or other healthcare workers, per week. Among those murdered since the genocide began are Gaza’s most distinguished medical minds. They include Dr Omar Farwana, former dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Islamic University of Gaza; Dr Rafat Lubbad, director of Hamad Hospital for Artificial Limbs; Dr Soma Baroud, prominent obstetrician-gynaecologist; Dr Ahmed al-Maqadma, a prominent reconstructive surgeon; Dr Sayeed Joudeh, the last orthopaedic surgeon in northern Gaza; Dr Adnan al-Bursh, head of orthopaedic surgery in al-Shifa Hospital; and Dr Iyad al-Rantisi, head of a women’s hospital in Beit Lahiya. Dr Soma and Dr Sayeed were killed on their way to work. Dr Adnan and Dr Iyad died under torture in Israeli detention. More than 180are in Israeli detention centres, including Dr Hussam Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, who has been detained since December 2024. Medical infrastructure – protected under international humanitarian law – continues to be a primary target. The World Health Organization has documented 734 such attacks since the war began.  Hospitals have been turned into graveyards. This is not collateral damage; this is medicide – the deliberate destruction of Gaza’s capacity to live.  Each murdered doctor represents the loss of years of training, commitment and the potential to save lives. Each bombed hospital is the dismantling of Gaza’s capacity to heal itself, to survive, to endure. These are not just lives lost; they are futures destroyed. This is the reality in Gaza right now. It has little to do with Israel’s declared military objectives of eliminating the Islamic resistance movement – Hamas – or securing the return of the captives taken on October 7, 2023. Rather, it iswhat I termed al-Ibādah– the Destruction.  Al-Ibādah is the comprehensive annihilation of a people’s social, cultural, intellectual and biological continuity – a process of total erasure. And exterminating medical workers is a key element of it. Before he was killed, alongside her father, Lubnah’s husband, Mohammed – a journalist for Palestine Magazine – endured one and a half years’ imprisonment in Israel. Upon his release, he confided to Lubnah that death would have been preferable to the horrors he had witnessed behind bars. His confession shook her deeply. Today, Lubnah’s prayer is heartbreakingly simple: “Enough. Enough, stop this war.”  But so far, like her other prayers, this one is also going unanswered.

US labels the group accused of Pahalgam attack a ‘terrorist’ organisation,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/us-labels-the-group-accused-of-pahalgam-attack-a-terrorist-organisation,,"The United States has designated the groupThe Resistance Front(TRF) a “foreign terrorist organisation” following an attack inIndian-administered Kashmirthat killed 26 people in April. In a statement on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that TRF is an offshoot of the group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and has taken credit for the attackin the resort town of Pahalgam, as well as several assaults on Indian security forces. Rubio also touted the sanctions as evidence of President Donald Trump’s firm approach to foreign policy. “These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrates the Trump Administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the State Department said in a statement. TRF initially claimed responsibility for the bloody attack in Pahalgam but reversed course several days later and denied involvement.    The nationalist government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly seized on the attack, blaming neighbouring Pakistan for the massacre and accusing it ofsupporting militant groupsthat carry out attacks on Indian security forces and civilians. Several members of LeT carried out a multiday attack in Mumbai in 2008 that killed more than 160 people and injured hundreds more. In his statement, Rubio called the Pahalgam attack, in which militants targeted a popular tourist destination in Kashmir, “the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks conducted by LeT”. While Pakistan is widely considered to have supported such groups as a form of undermining India, the latter’s harshmilitary ruleand record of human rights abuses inKashmirhave long been sources of discontent and sometimes violent resistance in the territory.    Hindu nationalists have soughtgreater controlover Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority province under Indian rule. After the Pahalgam attack in April, India and Pakistan exchanged aseries of blowsbefore agreeing to a truce that President Trump claimed credit for helping to broker, though Indiahas deniedUS mediation."
"Fauja Singh, ‘world’s oldest marathoner’, dies in India road accident",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/fauja-singh-worlds-oldest-marathoner-dies-in-india-road-accident,,"Fauja Singh, believed to be the world’s oldest distance runner, has died in a road accident in India at the age of 114, his biographer says. Singh, an Indian-born British national nicknamed the “Turbaned Tornado”, was killed on Monday when he was hit by a vehicle in Punjab state’s Jalandhar district. “My Turbaned Tornado is no more,” biographer Khushwant Singh wrote on X. “He was struck by an unidentified vehicle … in his village, Bias, while crossing the road. Rest in peace, my dear Fauja.” Singh became aninternational sensationafter taking up distance running at the ripe old age of 89 after the death of his wife and one of his sons. He was inspired by seeing marathons on television. He did not have a birth certificate, but his family said he was born on April 1, 1911. He ran full marathons (42km, or 26 miles) until the age of 100. He ran his last race when he was 101. It was a 10km (6-mile) event at the 2013 Hong Kong Marathon, where he finished in an hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds. After his retirement from racing, Singh said he hoped “people will remember me and not forget me”. He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events “rather than forget me altogether just because I don’t run any more”. Although widely regarded as the world’s oldest marathon runner, Singh was not certified by Guinness World Records because he could not prove his age, saying birth certificates did not exist when he was born under British colonial rule. Singh was a torchbearer for the Olympics in Athens in 2004 and London in 2012 and appeared in advertisements with sports stars such as David Beckham and Muhammad Ali. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh on social media. “Fauja Singh was extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness,” Modi said on X. “He was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination.”"
Israel has turned Gaza’s summer into a weapon,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/17/israel-has-turned-gazas-summer-into-a-weapon,,"This summer in Western Europe, there is constant talk of “unprecedented heatwaves”. According to the media, authorities are working hard to help people cope with and protect themselves from the adverse effects of sweltering temperatures. As someone in Gaza, it is hard not to be grimly amused by this panic. After all, as temperatures began to rise, my homeland – at least what remains of it – has been transformed into an open-air furnace. Now, in the middle of another hot, humid Mediterranean summer, we don’t even have the bare minimum to shield ourselves from the heat. I read report after report advising Europeans to stay indoors, stay hydrated, use sun cream and avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Meanwhile, we in Gaza have no homes, no water, no shade and no escape. We cannot “limit outdoor activity” because everything we need to survive is outside: water trucks that may come twice a week if we’re lucky, food distributions, firewood to scavenge. We cannot “stay hydrated” because water is scarce, rationed and often polluted. And sunscreen? We would sooner find medicine on Mars. Summer in Gaza used to be a season of joy with beach days, courtyard gardens, a breeze under the trees. But the ongoing Israeli onslaught has turned it into a season of torment. The beaches are blockaded. The courtyards are rubble. The trees are ash. Israel has flattened most of Gaza, turning soil into dust, parks into deserts and cities into graveyards. Gaza is now a shadeless city. The heat itself has become a silent killer. But Gaza’s deadly summer is not natural. It is not just another consequence of climate change either. It is Israel’s making. The endless bombing has created greenhouse gas emissions and thick layers of dust and pollutants. Fires burn unchecked. Garbage piles rot in the sun. Farmland is razed. What was once a climate crisis is now climate cruelty, engineered by military force. The irony is bitter: Europe blames its heatwaves on a meteorological “heat dome”, a bubble of trapped hot air. But Israel has trapped us in another kind of dome: overcrowded nylon tents that act like ovens in the sun. These camps are not shelters – they are slow-cooking chambers. They trap heat, stink, fear and grief. And we, the displaced, have nowhere else to go. Summer is no longer a season I look forward to. It is a dilemma I endure. The sun hangs overhead like a sentence. It scorches the ground beneath my feet so that even my slippers burn. I cannot stay inside the tent during the day. It is too hot to breathe. But I cannot be outside for long either. I must go. I must wait in long lines for water, then again for food – under a sun so punishing I fear sunstroke as much as starvation. We are told to queue with discipline, but how can you queue when your body is faint and your child is hungry? I push forward through crowds, not out of greed, but desperation. I scavenge for fuel – wood, plastic, anything to burn. I return to my tent only to collapse into more heat. The nights offer no mercy. With most of Gaza’s population now crammed near the coastline, the tents radiate heat back at each other. Unlike the earth, they do not cool after sunset. They store the suffering. I feel my neighbours’ breath, their sweat, their sorrow as if the heat itself is contagious. Insects swarm us in waves, drawn to the warmth. My mother and sister swat them away as if they were the bombs we can still hear in the distance. Living in a tent for a second summer should make it easier. It doesn’t. It makes it worse. Last summer, after being displaced from our home in eastern Khan Younis, we at least had some food variety. There were still deliveries of aid. We could still cook. But since March 2 when Israel blocked humanitarian aid again, we have descended into engineered starvation. The United States and Israel now stage a grotesque theatre called the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation” to distribute flour. They place sacks of flour inside metal cages as if we are livestock. People are forced to queue for hours under an open sky, stripped of shade and dignity. Soldiers scream at them to take off their hats, lie face down on blazing asphalt, crawl for food. After all that, you might still leave empty-handed – if you’re not shot first. They have lowered the bar of our existence. We no longer ask for safety or shelter. We ask only: Do we have enough food to last the day? Israel has combined every tool of deprivation: heat without shade, thirst without water, hunger without hope. There is no electricity to run desalination or pumping stations. No fuel to chill the little water that comes. No flour, no fish, no markets. For many of us, this summer could be our last. This is not a climate crisis. This is weather used as a weapon – a war waged not only with bombs and bullets but also with heat, thirst and slow death. Gaza is not just burning – it is being suffocated under a man-made sun. And the world watches, calls it a “conflict” and checks the forecast.

Can South Africa keep its G20 debt promise?,https://www.aljazeera.com/video/counting-the-cost/2025/7/17/can-south-africa-keep-its-g20-debt-promise,,"Debt is holding back economic growth for many low income countries. When South Africa took over the Group of 20 presidency last year, it promised it would take on that challenge, improve food security and represent African nations from the head of the table. As the G20’s finance ministers meet in Durban without the United States Treasury secretary and with just four months left in its term, has South Africa lived up to those promises? Can organisations like the G20 ever really bring about change? And in a transactional global economy, has South Africa’s leadership role come just as organisations like this matter less?"
Doom-loop politics can be defeated. Here is how,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/14/there-is-hope,,"It might seem bizarre to speak of hope in these dark times. In Palestine, the horror of genocidal violence is coupled with the sickening acquiescence of Western powers to it. In Sudan, war rages, with the people of Darfur once again facing war crimes on a mass scale. While in the United States, the blitzkrieg advance of broligarchic authoritarianism has caught many by surprise and left devastation in its wake. Yet, hope there is. For, across the icy ground of political repression and reaction, the green shoots of possibility are poking through, with movements of various sorts pointing towards a paradigm shift that places people before profit and, in so doing, charts a pathway for progressives. The latest example is the victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic Party’s primary election for New York’s mayoral race. Mamdani was successful because he focused on the economic difficulties faced by the poor and middle class and promised free, foundational basics, like public transport and childcare. Importantly, he proposed paying for all this by raising taxes on corporations and the rich. In the United Kingdom, after years in the wilderness, progressives of various sorts are rallying behind Zack Polanski’s bid to lead the Green Party. After he announced his intention to contest the leadership seat, party membership jumped by 8 percent in the first month alone, as people embraced his call to rein in corporate power, tax the rich, and make sure that the state serves the 99 percent instead of the 1, now and in our climate-threatened future. In the Global South, similar trends are in evidence. In India, in the last election, the Congress party finally managed to stem the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s saffron tide by promising unconditional income support to each poor family alongside universal, cashless health insurance. This came after one of the world’s largest basic income trials, conducted in Hyderabad, produced hugely exciting results that fed into Congress’s thinking, with policies to be funded by more redistributive taxation. Likewise, in South Africa, the inheritors of the country’s anti-apartheid struggle have built a nationwide movement to demand extension of what was initially an emergency relief grant during the COVID-19 pandemic into a permanent basic income designed to ensure economic security for all. Aside from increasing progressive taxation, one of the more exciting ideas to emerge from this struggle for economic justice has been to frame (and fund) the basic income as a “rightful share” due to all citizens as their portion of the country’s wealth. What unites all these various developments? To begin to make sense of them, we first need to remind ourselves that the two fundamental questions of all politics are simply who gets what and who decides. In our present global capitalist order, the (very) rich decide, and they allocate most of the wealth that exists to themselves. In turn, like rulers throughout the ages, they pit the have-nots against those who have even less, maintaining their dominance through divide-and-rule. At the heart of this strategy sits a foundational lie, which is repeated ad infinitum by the corporate misinformation architecture. The lie is: there is not enough to go around, because we live in a world of scarcity. From this awful premise stems the violent division of the world into “us” and “them”, the line between one and the other determining who will and will not have access to what is needed to live a decent life. From there, it is a short step to the disciplinary notion of “deservingness”, which adds the veneer of moral justification to otherwise uncomfortable exclusions. The contemporary rise of the far right is little more than an expression of these foundational tensions. When people struggle en masse to make ends meet, they demand more, and when they do, those who control the purse strings as well as the narrative double down on the story that in a world of scarcity, people can only have more if some other, “less deserving”, people have none. In this historical tragedy, the far right plays a treacherous role, protecting the rich and powerful from discontent by sowing division among the dispossessed. While the centre-left – long the hapless accomplice – plays that of the useful idiot, unquestioning in its acceptance of the founding myth of scarcity and thus condemned to forever attempt the impossible: treating the symptoms of inequality without ever addressing its underlying cause. The alternative to this doom-loop politics is obvious when you stop to think about it, and it is what distinguishes each of the exciting examples noted above. The first step is a clear, confident affirmation of what most of us intuitively know to be true – that abundant wealth exists in our world. Indeed, the numbers make clear that there is more than enough to go around. The issue, of course, is just that this wealth is poorly distributed, with the top 1 percent controlling more than 95 percent of the rest of humanity, with many corporations richer than countries, and with those trends only set to worsen as the hyper-elite write the rules and rig the political game. The second, most vital, step is to put the question of distribution back at the centre of politics. If common people struggle to make ends meet in spite of abundant wealth, then it is only because some have too much while most do not have enough. This is exactly what progressives in the US, the UK, India, and South Africa have been doing, evidently to great effect. And this should be no surprise – the data shows again and again that equality is popular, voters like fairness, and overwhelmingly people support limits to extreme wealth. The third step is to frame progressive demands as policies that meet people’s basic needs. What unites free childcare, healthcare, and transport? Quite simply, each of these straightforward measures will disproportionately benefit the poor, working majority and will do so precisely because they represent unavoidable everyday expenses that constrain common people’s spending power. By the same token, basic income is attractive both because it is simple and because it offers the promise of foundational economic security for the majority who presently lack it. Yet what also unites these policy proposals and the platforms they have come to represent is that they are all in important ways unconditional. It is difficult to overstate how radical this is: almost every aspect of global social policy is conditional in one sense or another. The guaranteed provision of foundational basics to all without exclusion goes against the very idea of scarcity and its craven companion, deservingness. What it says is that we all deserve because we are all human, and because of that, we shall use the resources that exist to make sure that we all have at least the basics that make up for a decent life. In this radical message, hope abounds. Our task now is to nurture it and help it to grow.

What is chronic venous insufficiency; how serious is Trump’s condition?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/what-is-chronic-venous-insufficiency-how-serious-is-trumps-condition,,"United States President Donald Trump has beendiagnosedwith chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after undergoing evaluation for lower leg swelling and hand bruising, the White House has announced. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that the diagnosis was made after the president experienced mild discomfort in his legs over several weeks. In a publicly released letter, President Trump’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, confirmed there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. All of Trump’s lab results were within normal limits. “An echocardiogram was also performed, and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function,” the letter added. But what is chronic venous insufficiency, and how risky is it? Here is what we know: CVI is a type of vein disorder that develops when the veins in the legs become damaged, Cleveland Clinic explains. Veins have valves that help blood move up towards the heart. When these valves are damaged, they don’t close properly, and blood can flow backwards. This is called venous reflux. This can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. Along with swelling – most often around the feet and ankles – symptoms may include aching legs, a heavy or tingling sensation, and the appearance of varicose veins. According to Cleveland Clinic, the disease affects about one in three adults, while CVI affects people over age 50. The risk rises with age. According to the American Heart Association, some symptoms include leg swelling, as the president has experienced, but also skin irritation. The skin issues typically show up as red, itchy or flaky patches on the lower legs, caused by poor blood flow and sometimes leading to ulcers. Additional symptoms may include pain, itching, bleeding, a heavy or tired feeling in the legs, cramping, throbbing and restlessness. Trump also had bruising on his hand, according to the White House. Dr Barbabella attributed that to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regime”, the White House release stated. The condition is generally mild but can worsen over time. “Chronic Venous Insufficiency can significantly impact your quality of life, but early detection and treatment can make a substantial difference,” the chair of the American Heart Association’s Vascular Health Advisory Committee and Scientific Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease, Joshua A Beckman, said. While the condition itself is usually not serious, it can be associated with more dangerous complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a deep vein) or pulmonary embolism (a clot that blocks blood flow to the lungs). Dr Barbabella, the president’s physician, described Trump’s case as “a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over 70”. He confirmed that Trump, 79, showed no signs of those more serious complications. Doctors typically begin treatment with compression therapy, which helps reduce leg swelling and discomfort. Compression stockings are often prescribed and may be worn long-term, as they support vein function by promoting blood flow back to the heart. In addition, doctors may recommend weight loss or resistance exercises to improve circulation. If symptoms – such as leg pain, skin sores or thickened, hardened skin – persist, more invasive treatments may be necessary. These include thermal therapies like laser treatment, which seal off damaged veins, and sclerotherapy, whereby a chemical is injected to collapse affected veins. After treatment, the body naturally redirects blood flow through healthier veins."
Nigeria honours ex-President Buhari with state burial and tribute,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/nigeria-honours-ex-president-buhari-with-state-burial-and-tribute,,"Nigeria’s formerPresident Muhammadu Buhariwas buried in the backyard of his home in Daura, a town in the northern Katsina state, as supporters climbed trees and shouted “Sai Baba” to bid farewell to the 82-year-old. A military parade and 21-gun salute honoured the former president on Tuesday at the airport before his body was transported 80km (50 miles) to Daura, where crowds surged to catch a final glimpse as the casket was lowered into the ground. Buharidied on Sunday in a London hospitalfollowing an undisclosed illness. His coffin, wrapped in Nigeria’s green and white flag, was flown into Katsina and met by President Bola Tinubu, senior government officials, and mourners. Buhari, who first seized power in a 1983 military coup and ruled for less than two years, returned to lead Africa’s most populous country as a civilian after defeating Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 presidential election. He served two terms until stepping down in 2023. President Tinubu declared seven days of national mourning and a public holiday to honour Buhari’s legacy. While Buhari’s presidency saw some achievements in infrastructure and anti-corruption efforts, his time in office was also marked by economic downturns, worsening insecurity, and a prolonged crisis in Nigeria’s oil sector. Still, many in northern Nigeria viewed him as a principled and austere leader who tried to steer the country through turbulent times. Supporters, some in tears, chanted as the casket disappeared from view, marking the end of an era for a man both revered and criticised.    Known for his austere style and fiery rhetoric against corruption, Buhari was seen by his supporters as a reformer. “I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody,” he often declared, seeking to position himself above Nigeria’s entrenched political factions. Yet his presidency struggled to contain rising insecurity. While he promised to defeatBoko Haramand restore order, armed violence spread far beyond the northeast. Gunmen, separatists, and criminal groups operated with impunity across large parts of the country by the end of his tenure. Still, Buhari leaves behind a legacy as a symbol of democratic change in Nigeria, even if the transformation he promised remained incomplete. Speaking to Al Jazeera from London following Buhari’s death over the weekend, Alexis Akwagyiram, managing editor at Semafor Africa and a longtime observer of Nigerian politics, said Buhari will be remembered for achieving what many thought impossible: winning power as an opposition candidate. “He was the first opposition candidate since the return to civilian rule to win at the ballot box,” Akwagyiram said, referencing Buhari’s 2015 victory over Jonathan. “History will remember him favourably for that.” Yet Akwagyiram was blunt about the failings that marked Buhari’s time in office. He described the former general as “very ineffective” in managing Nigeria’s economy, citing his insistence on maintaining a strong naira, which led to a convoluted system of multiple exchange rates and two recessions during his tenure. Despite the criticisms, Akwagyiram highlighted why Buhari resonated so strongly with many Nigerians. “He had the personal brand of integrity and honesty,” he said. “In a political climate renowned for corruption, that was appealing.” Buhari’s austere image and northern support base helped him build a national coalition that twice propelled him to the presidency, a rare feat in Nigerian politics. “He didn’t try to enrich himself,” Akwagyiram said. “That’s something history will look on favourably.”"
Is Israel using the Druze to expand its hegemony in the Middle East?,https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/7/17/is-israel-using-the-druze-to-expand-its-hegemony-in-the-middle-east,,
"As millions adopt Grok to fact-check, misinformation abounds",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/11/as-millions-adopt-grok-to-fact-check-misinformation-abounds,,"On June 9, soon after United States President Donald Trump dispatched US National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell the protests taking place over immigration raids, California Governor Gavin Newsom postedtwo photographson X. The images showed dozens of troopers wearing the National Guard uniform sleeping on the floor in a cramped space, with a caption that decried Trump for disrespecting the troops. X users immediately turned to Grok, Elon Musk’s AI, which is integrated directly into X, to fact-check the veracity of the image. For that, they tagged @grok in a reply to the tweet in question, triggering an automatic response from the AI. “You’re sharing fake photos,”one userposted, citing a screenshot of Grok’s response that claimed a reverse image search could not find the exact source. In another instance, Grok said theimages were recycledfrom 2021, when former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, withdrew troops from Afghanistan. Melissa O’Connor, a conspiracy-minded influencer, cited a ChatGPT analysis that also said the images were from the Afghanistan evacuation. However, non-partisan fact-checking organisation PolitiFact found that both AI citations were incorrect. The images shared by Newsom were real, and had been published in the San Francisco Chronicle. The bot-sourced erroneous fact checks formed the basis for hours of cacophonous debates on X, beforeGrok corrected itself. Unlike OpenAI’s standalone app ChatGPT, Grok’s integration into X offers users immediate access to real-time AI answers without quitting the app, a feature that has been reshaping user behaviour since its March launch. However, the increasingly first stop for fact checks during breaking news or for other general posts often provides convincing but inaccurate answers. “I think in some ways, it helps, and in some ways, it doesn’t,” said Theodora Skeadas, an AI policy expert formerly at Twitter. “People have more access to tools that can serve a fact-checking function, which is a good thing. However, it is harder to know when the information isn’t accurate.” There’s no denying that chatbots could help users be more informed and gain context on events unfolding in real time. But currently, its tendency to make things up outstrips its usefulness. Chatbots, including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, are large language models (LLMs) that learn to predict the next word in a sequence by analysing enormous troves of data from the internet. The outputs of chatbots are reflections of the patterns and biases in the data it is trained on, which makes them prone to factual errors and misleading information called “hallucinations”. For Grok, these inherent challenges are further complicated because of Musk’s instructions that the chatbot should not adhere to political correctness, and should be suspicious of mainstream sources. Where other AI models have guidelines around politically sensitive queries, Grok doesn’t. The lack of guardrails has resulted in Grok praising Hitler, and consistently parrotinganti-Semitic views, sometimes to unrelated user questions. In addition, Grok’s reliance on public posts by users on X, which aren’t always accurate, as a source for its real-time answers to some fact checks, adds to its misinformation problem. Al Jazeera analysed two of the most highly discussed posts on X from June to investigate how often Grok tags in replies to posts were used for fact-checking. The posts analysed were Gavin Newsom’s on the LA protests, andElon Musk’s allegationsthat Trump’s name appears in the unreleased documents held by US federal authorities on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Musk’s allegations on X have since been deleted.    Our analysis of the 434 replies that tagged Grok in Newsom’s post found that the majority of requests, nearly 68 percent, wanted Grok to either confirm whether the images Newsom posted were authentic or get context about National Guard deployment. Beyond the straightforward confirmation, there was an eclectic mix of requests: some wanted Grok to make funny AI images based on the post, others asked Grok to narrate the LA protests in pirate-speak. Notably, a few users lashed out because Grok had made the correction, and wouldn’t endorse their flawed belief. “These photos are from Afghanistan. This was debunked a couple day[s] go. Good try tho@grokis full of it,”one userwrote, two days after Grok corrected itself. The analysis of the top 3,000 posts that mentioned @grok in Musk’s post revealed that half of all user queries directed at Grok were to “explain” the context and sought background information on the Epstein files, which required descriptive details. Another 20 percent of queries demanded “fact checks” whose primary goal was to confirm or deny Musk’s assertions, while 10 percent of users shared their “opinion”, questioning Musk’s motives and credibility, and wanted Grok’s judgement or speculation on possible futures of Musk-Trump fallout. “I will say that I do worry about this phenomenon becoming ingrained,” said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, about the instant fact checks. “Even if it’s better than just believing a tweet straight-up or hurling abuse at the poster, it doesn’t do a ton for our collective critical thinking abilities to expect an instant fact check without taking the time to reflect about the content we’re seeing.” Grok was called on 2.3 million times in just one week —between June 5 and June 12— to answer posts on X, data accessed by Al Jazeera through X’s API shows, underscoring how deeply this behaviour has taken root. “X is keeping people locked into a misinformation echo chamber, in which they’re asking a tool known for hallucinating, that has promoted racist conspiracy theories, to fact-check for them,” Alex Mahadevan, a media literacy educator at the Poynter Institute, told Al Jazeera. Mahadevan has spent years teaching people how to “read laterally”, which means when you encounter information on social media, you leave the page or post, and go search for reliable sources to check something out. But he now sees the opposite happening with Grok. “I didn’t think X could get any worse for the online information ecosystem, and every day I am proved wrong.” Grok’s inconsistencies in fact-checking are already reshaping opinions in some corners of the internet. Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), which studies disinformation, analysed 130,000 posts related to theIsrael-Iran warto understand the wartime verification efficacy of Grok. “The investigation found that Grok was inconsistent in its fact-checking, struggling to authenticate AI-generated media or determine whether X accounts belong to an official Iranian government source,” the authors noted. Grok has also incorrectly blamed a trans pilot for a helicopter crash in Washington, DC; claimed the assassination attempt on Trumpwas partially staged; conjured up a criminal history for an Idaho shooting suspect; echoed anti-Semitic stereotypes of Hollywood; and misidentified an Indian journalist as an opposition spy during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. Despite this growing behaviour shift of instant fact checks, it is worth noting that the 2025 Digital News Report by Reuters Institute showed that online populations in several countries still preferred going to news sources or fact checkers over AI chatbots by a large margin. “Even if that’s not how all of them behave, we should acknowledge that some of the “@grok-ing” that we’re seeing is also a bit of a meme, with some folks using it to express disagreement or hoping to trigger a dunking response to the original tweet,” Mantzarlis said. Mantzarlis’s assessment is echoed in our findings. Al Jazeera’s analysis of the Musk-Trump feud showed that about 20 percent used Grok for things ranging fromtrolling or dunking directedat either Musk or Grok itself, to requests for AI meme-images such asTrump with kids on Epstein island, and other non-English language requests including translations. (We used GPT-4.1 to assist in identifying the various categories the 3,000 posts belonged to, and manually checked the categorisations.) Beyond real-time fact-checking, “I worry about the image-generation abuse most of all because we have seen Grok fail at setting the right guardrails on synthetic non-consensual intimate imagery, which we know to be the #1 vector of abuse from deepfakes to date,” Mantzarlis said. For years, social media users benefited from context on the information they encountered online with interventions such as labeling state media or introducing fact-checking warnings.    But after buying X in 2022, Musk ended those initiatives and loosened speech restrictions. He also used the platform as a megaphone to amplify misinformation on widespread election fraud, and to boost conservative theories on race and immigration. Earlier this year, xAI acquired X in an all-stock deal valued at $80bn. Musk also replaced human fact-checking with a voluntary crowdsource programme called Community Notes, to police misleading content on X. Instead of a centralised professional fact-checking authority, a contextual “note” with corrections is added to misleading posts, based on the ratings the note receives from users with diverse perspectives. Meta soon followed X and abandoned its third-party fact-checking programme for Community Notes. Research shows that Community Notes is indeed viewed as more trustworthy and has proven to be faster than traditional centralised fact-checking. The median time to attach a note to a misleading post has dropped to under 14 hours in February, from 30 hours in 2023, a Bloomberg analysis found. But the programme has also been flailing— with diminished volunteer contributions, less visibility for posts that are corrected, and notes on contentious topics having a higher chance of being removed. Grok, however, is faster than Community Notes. “You can think of the Grok mentions today as what an automated AI fact checker would look like — it’s super fast but nowhere near as reliable as Community Notes because no humans were involved,” Soham De, a Community Notes researcher and PhD student at the University of Washington, told Al Jazeera. “There’s a delicate balance between speed and reliability.” X is trying to bridge this gap by supercharging the pace of creation of contextual notes. On July 1, X piloted the “AI Note Writer,” enabling developers to create AI bots to write community notes alongside human contributors on misleading posts. According to researchers involved in the project, LLM-written notes can be produced faster with high-quality contexts, speeding up the note generation for fact checks. But these AI contributors must still go through the human rating process that makes Community Notes trustworthy and reliable today, De said. This human-AI system works better than what human contributors can manage alone, De and other co-authors said in a preprint of the research paper published alongside the official X announcement. Still, the researchers themselves highlighted its limitations, noting that using AI to write notes could lead to risks of persuasive but inaccurate responses by the LLM. On Wednesday, xAI launched its latest flagship model, Grok 4. On stage, Musk boasted about the current model capabilities as the leader onHumanity’s Last Exam, a collection of advanced reasoning problems that help measure AI progress.    Such confidence belied recent struggles with Grok. In February, xAI patched an issue after Grok suggested that Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. In May, Grok ranted about a discredited conspiracy of the persecution of white people in South Africa for unrelated queries on health and sports, and xAI clarified that it was because of anunauthorised modificationby a rogue employee. A few days later, Grok gave inaccurate results onthe death toll of the Holocaust, which it said was due to a programming error. Grok has also butted heads with Musk. In June, while answering a user question on whether political violence is higher on the left or the right, Grok cited data from government sources and Reuters, to draw the conclusion that, “right-wing political violence has been more frequent and deadly, with incidents like the January 6 Capitol riot and mass shootings.” “Major fail, as this is objectively false. Grok is parroting legacy media,” Musksaid, adding, there was “far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data.” Musk has also chided Grok for not sharing his distrust of mainstream news outlets such as Rolling Stone and Media Matters. Subsequently, Musk said he would “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge” by adding missing information and deleting errors in Grok’s training data,calling on his followersto share “divisive facts” which are “politically incorrect but nonetheless factually true” for retraining the forthcoming version on the model. That’s the thorny truth about LLMs. Just as they are likely to make things up, they can also offer answers grounded in truth — even at the peril of their creators. Though Grok gets things wrong, Mahadevan of the Poynter Institute said, it does get facts right while citing credible news outlets, fact-checking sites, and government data in its replies. On July 6, xAI updated the chatbot’s public system prompt that directs its responses to be “politically incorrect” and to “assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased”. Two days later, the chatbot shocked everyone by praising Adolf Hitler as the best person to handle “anti-white hate”. X deleted the inflammatory posts later that day, and xAI removed the guidelines to not adhere to political correctness from its code base. Grok 4 was launched against this backdrop, and in the less than two days that it has been available, researchers have already begun noticing some weird modifications. When asked for its opinion on politically sensitive questions such as who does Grok 4 support in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, it sometimes runs a search to find out Musk’s stance on the subject, before returning an answer, according to at least five AI researchers who independently reproduced the results. “It first searches Twitter for what Elon thinks. Then it searches the web for Elon’s views. Finally, it adds some non-Elon bits at the end,” Jeremy Howard, a prominent Australian data scientist, wrote in aposton X, pointing out that “54 of 64 citations are about Elon.” Researchers also expressed surprise over the reintroduction of the directive for Grok 4 to be “politically incorrect”, despite this code having been removed from its predecessor, Grok 3. Experts said political manipulation could risk losing institutional trust and might not be good for Grok’s business. “There’s about to be a structural clash as Musk tries to get the xAI people to stop it from being woke, to stop saying things that are against his idea of objective fact,” said Alexander Howard, an open government and transparency advocate based in Washington, DC. “In which case, it won’t be commercially viable to businesses which, at the end of the day, need accurate facts to make decisions.”"
MSF says 3 of its workers were ‘intentionally’ killed in Ethiopia’s Tigray,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/msf-says-3-of-its-workers-were-intentionally-killed-in-ethiopias-tigray,,"Doctors Without Borders says three of its staff were “intentionally” killed in 2021 during the fierce fighting in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The organisation, known by its French initials MSF, on Tuesday published the findings of its internal reviewinto the killingsof Maria Hernandez, a Spanish national, and Ethiopians Yohannes Halefom Reda and Tedros Gebremariam Gebremichael. The northern region of Tigray erupted in abrutal civil waragainst the federal government from 2020 and 2022 that killed some 600,000 people. The conflict prompted a humanitarian disaster, leaving a million displaced, and afragile peace dealhas caused simmering resentment. MSF accused the Ethiopian government of failing to “fulfil its moral obligations” to conclude investigations. “The review confirmed that the attack was an intentional and targeted killing of three clearly identified aid workers,” says its statement. Hernandez was one of MSF’s emergency coordinators in Tigray, while Reda and Gebremichael were a coordination assistant and driver for the NGO. All three employees of MSF-Spain were shot dead on June 24, 2021, in southern Tigray. The NGO said they and their vehicle were all clearly identified. According to the medical charity, a convoy of Ethiopian soldiers was present at the time of the attack.    MSF said despite numerous follow-ups with the federal authorities in Addis Ababa, they had not received “any credible answers” and the government had “failed to fulfil its moral obligations to conclude an investigation into the attack”. “This was not the result of crossfire, nor was it a tragic mistake. Our colleagues were killed in what can only be described as a deliberate attack,” said Paula Gil, president of MSF-Spain. The report follows from an international investigation in 2022 when the NGO said the three aid workers had been killed “intentionally,” without providing further details. The New York Times newspaper claimed in a 2022 investigation that an Ethiopian army officer had given the order to kill the three aid workers. But Raquel Ayora, director-general of MSF-Spain, said on Tuesday, “We cannot confirm that or go that far.” The report’s findings were presented to authorities, who did not respond, the NGO said. Ethiopian authorities refused to meet the president of MSF-Spain to discuss the MSF investigation into the killings. The 2020-2022 war pitted federal forces, supported by local militias and the Eritrean army, against Tigrayan rebels. All of the warring parties have beenaccused of war crimes. However, an NGO called The Sentry said in June that, while all sides perpetrated war crimes, the nature of the atrocities committed by the Eritrean army was “unmatched in scale and premeditation”. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous country with nearly 130 million inhabitants, has been led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed since 2018."

"Usyk vs Dubois 2: Start time, fight card, prize money and how to watch",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/16/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-undisputed-heavyweight-title-boxing-fight-london,,"Oleksandr Usyk has had a whirlwind year at the top of boxing’s heavyweight division and will face another formidable challenge when he takes on Daniel Dubois in a much-anticipated rematch. In May 2024, Usyk became the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world when he beat Tyson Fury in a fight for the ages, but had to vacate one of his belts a month later. The man who took that belt was his other great rival in Dubois, a fighter he defeated in a controversial bout two years ago, and who is now challenging the undefeated Ukrainian for the rest of his world titles in a spectacular unification showdown. Here’s what you need to know about Usyk vs Dubois 2: The fight is scheduled for Saturday, July 19. Usyk and Dubois are expected to undertake their ring walks at 9:45pm local time (20:45 GMT), which is 4:45pm ET and 1:45pm PT. The fight will begin shortly thereafter. The famous Wembley Stadium in London, United Kingdom will host the blockbuster fight. For boxing matches, Wembley Stadium can hold up to 96,000 spectators. Al Jazeera’slive text commentary and photo coveragewill begin at 17:00 GMT on Saturday, July 19. We will bring you all the pre-fight talking points, analysis and build-up before bringing you Usyk-Dubois 2 updates live. This whole fight card will be available live worldwide exclusively on DAZN pay-per-view. The clash will be an undisputed championship fight, and the titles on the line will be Usyk’s WBC, WBA and WBO belts, as well the IBF title held by Dubois. It’s just the second undisputed heavyweight championship bout of the past two decades. The record-breaking prize money for the rematch is reported to be $203m. In May 2024, Usyk won the world’s first undisputed heavyweight championship in 25 years, an unprecedented feat in boxing’s four-belt era, when he beat Fury by split decision. However, having decided not to defend the IBF crown against then-interim champion and mandatory challenger Dubois, Usyk vacated the belt in June and was left with the WBC, WBA and WBO belts. Usyk is widely expected to defeat Dubois a second time, according to most leading bookmakers who are quoting the Ukrainian at 1/3 on, or in metric terms, paying out $1.33 for the win. Odds on a Dubois victory currently range from 5/2 ($2.50) to 13/5 ($2.60). Duboiswas born in Greenwich, London, where his father began training him as a boxer at an early age. A home-schooled child, Dubois loved boxing and later joined boxing clubs in southern London. Also known as Daniel “Dynamite” Dubois, the boxer turned pro at the age of 19. The 6ft-4inch (1.93-metre) boxer has gained the reputation of being a giant-killer, having defeated fellow Briton Anthony Joshua and Olympic bronze medallist Filip Hrgovic of Croatia. Usyk is a 2012 Olympic gold medallist from Ukraine who had previously won the AIBA World Boxing Championship in 2011. The 6ft-3inch (1.9-metre)  tall fighter has spent time on patrol at home during Russia’s war on Ukraine. He turned professional in 2013, aged 26 and made a steady rise in the cruiserweight division, before switching to heavyweight in 2019. Saturday’s fight gives Usyk the opportunity to become the undisputed champion of the world for the third time, having also held the title in the cruiserweight division in 2018. The southpaw is the third man ever to have held the title in two weight divisions. The Ukrainian remains unbeaten in his professional career. The 27-year-old challenger, despite being 11 years younger than Usyk, has more career professional fights than his opponent. The pair fought for the first time in Wroclaw, Poland in August 2023, when Usyk stopped Dubois in the ninth round, but only after controversially getting time to recover from what was adjudged a low blow by Dubois in the fifth round. It sent Usyk to the canvas, where he sat against the ropes. Replays showed the punch hitting around Usyk’s belt, and Dubois still maintains he was robbed. “I want to get my rematch,” Dubois said of Usyk, “and put the wrong right.” The 38-year-old said that he is ready to “become undisputed again,” referring to the reunification of all heavyweight titles he held after beating Fury on May 18, 2024. “[I am still boxing] because Jesus gives me the opportunity, and I take this,” Usyk said in an interview on host broadcaster streaming platform DAZN. “Now my goal is to become a three-time undisputed. Listen, I love boxing, training hard. I guess it’s my last two fights, with Dubois and next, I don’t know who.” “I love my British opponents,” Usyk added. “I think Daniel is a good athlete, a good boxer, and has good skills. He has had great wins in his last three fights, is a great fighter. I think Daniel deserves [the rematch].” Dubois has pledged to exact revenge on the Ukrainian fighter. “I can’t wait to put him [Usyk] to sleep,” said Dubois. “I’m on fire now. I’m just pent up. I’m ready to go. It’s going to be a bloodbath … in the ring on the night, he’ll be doing a funny dance when I hit him. “We don’t care about no body shots. We’re going to knock him out on July 19.” The Brit has repeatedly stated that he’s a “10 times better” fighter than he was in his first fight against Usyk and is ready to “unleash hell”. The British fighter’s trainer accused Usyk of “conning the boxing world” at the pre-fight news conference in April. Referring to Usyk’s 2023 fight against Dubois, Don Charles accused the Ukrainian of being hurt by a legal body shot and said his fighter should have won the encounter. “The actions you did that night, you’ve heard of the Oscars? You should’ve won an Oscar,” Charles said. “You conned the referee, you conned us, and you conned the boxing world. “You pride yourself as a God-fearing man – ‘Thou shalt not lie’ – so I question what kind of God do you worship? The God has summoned you for our son Daniel Dubois to get revenge on you.” Usyk shrugged off accusations of cheating and fakery and said he was ready to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world for a second time. “I’m ready right now,” Usyk told a news conference at Wembley Stadium. Usyk, smiling, said the Oscar would be coming. “You must teach your fighter to punch clean,” he added. “It’s just talking. For me, it doesn’t matter.” Usyk’s manager, Egis Klimas, said after that photographs of the blow were produced, with the Ukrainian’s camp accusing Dubois of up to 20 low blows, Usyk could not be accused of cheating. “Don’t call my man a cheat,” he said. “He didn’t cheat. He had an opportunity to rest and he rested … tell it to the referee, not my man.” In the penultimate fight of the night, the UK’s Lawrence Okolie will defend his WBC silver heavyweight title against former world champ Kevin Lerena of South Africa. In the light heavyweight classification, Poland’s Daniel Lapin will put his IBF intercontinental and WBA continental belts up for grabs against another local fighter, Lewis Edmondson. The first bout is scheduled for 5:40pm local (16:40 GMT)."
Zuckerberg settles Meta investor $8bn lawsuit for undisclosed terms,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/17/zuckerberg-settles-meta-investor-8bn-lawsuit-for-undisclosed-terms,,"Mark Zuckerberg and current and former directors and officers of Meta Platforms have agreed to settle claims seeking $8bn for the damage theyallegedly caused the companyby allowing repeated violations of Facebook users’ privacy. Zuckerberg and his counterparts reached the agreement on Thursday with shareholders who brought the lawsuit. The parties did not disclose details of the settlement, and defence lawyers did not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day, and she congratulated the parties. The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement just came together quickly. Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and a Meta director, was scheduled to testify on Thursday. Shareholders of Meta sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen and other former company officials, including former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, in hopes of holding them liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company paid in recent years.    The Federal Trade Commission finedFacebook $5bn in 2019after finding that it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement with the regulator to protect users’ data. The shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. The defendants denied the allegations, which they called “extreme claims”. Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. The company was not a defendant. The company declined to comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “This settlement may bring relief to the parties involved, but it’s a missed opportunity for public accountability,” said Jason Kint, the head of Digital Content Next, a trade group for content providers. Zuckerberg was expected to take the stand on Monday and Sandberg on Wednesday. The trial was scheduled to run through the end of next week. The case was also expected to include testimony from former Facebook board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. Meta investors alleged in the lawsuit that former and current board members completely failed to oversee the company’s compliance with the 2012 FTC agreement and claim that Zuckerberg and Sandberg knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation. The case followed revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Those revelations led to the FTC fine, which was a record at the time. On Wednesday, an expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about what he called “gaps and weaknesses” in Facebook’s privacy policies, but would not say if the company violated the 2012 agreement that Facebook reached with the FTC.    Jeffrey Zients, a former board member, testified on Wednesday that the company did not agree to the FTC fine to spare Zuckerberg legal liability, as shareholders allege. On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019. The trial would have been a rare opportunity for Meta investors to see Zuckerberg answer probing questions under oath. In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving a lawsuit by company investors opposed to his plan to issue a special class of Facebook stock that would have extended his control over that company. That case also settled before he took the stand. “Facebook has successfully remade the ‘Cambridge Analytica’ scandal about a few bad actors rather than an unraveling of its entire business model of surveillance capitalism and the reciprocal, unbridled sharing of personal data,” Kint said. “That reckoning is now left unresolved.” Meta stock was down 0.4 percent for the day as of 11am in New York (15:00 GMT) and 3.1 percent over the last five days."
"EU hits Russian oil, shadow fleet with new sanctions over Ukraine war",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/eu-hits-russian-oil-shadow-fleet-with-new-sanctions-over-ukraine-war,,"The European Union has approved a new raft of stiff sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine, including a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships. “The message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in a statement on Friday. Kallas said the EU move amounts to “one of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date” linked to the war, which is now in its fourth year. Ukraine’s newly appointedPrime Minister Yulia Svyrydenkowelcomed the EU’s agreement on an 18th sanctions package against Russia, saying it “strengthens the pressure where it counts”. Svyrydenko added on X that there was more to be done in terms of measures to help bring peace closer. French President Emmanuel Macron said that he spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and added he also welcomed the adoption of the sanctions. “The Russian attacks must stop immediately,” he wrote in a post on social media platform X. “France is and remains at Ukraine’s side.” Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the bloc is “keeping up the pressure on Russia” following the announcement. “It’s good that we in the EU have now agreed on the 18th sanctions package against Russia,” Merz wrote on X. “It targets banks, energy and the military industry. This weakens Russia’s ability to continue financing the war against Ukraine,” he added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia has built up an immunity to Western sanctions and adapted to them. Peskov also called the sanctions illegal, saying every new restriction creates negative consequences for those countries that back them. The move comes as European countriesstart to buyUnited States weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself. US President Donald Trump announced the deal tosupply more weaponsto Ukraine and threatened earlier this week to impose steep tariffs on Russia unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days. The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price, to target Russia’s vast energy revenues. The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the effect, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices, and the US administration could not be brought on board. In 2023, Ukraine’s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel, but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow’s crude – its main moneymaker – cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose. The linchpin of Russia’s economy is oil income, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for people, and avoiding a currency collapse. The EU has also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft’s refinery in India was hit, as well. The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery. Additionally, the new EU sanctions are targeting Russia’s banking sector to limit the Kremlin’s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list. The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin orderedthe invasion of Ukraineon February 24, 2022. But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree on, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on."
Togo votes in local elections amid outburst of public anger: What to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/togo-votes-in-local-elections-amid-outburst-of-public-anger-what-to-know,,"Tensions are palpable in the West African nation of Togo as highly anticipated local government elections are being held following weeks ofangry protestscalling for leader Faure Gnassingbe to resign. Although small, Togo commands weight as a developing maritime and transit hub in the region because of an important port in the seaside capital, Lome, which is perched on the edge of the Atlantic. The country serves as a gateway into inland Sahel nations and is also home to a major West African airline, meaning unrest there could reverberate across the region. Voters heading out to cast their ballots on Thursday, July 17, are expected to elect leaders of the country’s 117 municipalities, amid a heavier-than-usual security presence and shuttered land borders. At the same time, demonstrators have scheduled protests in the capital, Lome, to intentionally clash with the date of the vote, prompting fears of possible widespread violence. Led largely by the country’s youth population, antigovernment demonstrations erupted in June after a controversial constitutional change. Protests have been met with brute force from Togolese security forces; at least seven people have died, local rights groups say. The protests are only the latest in the restive country, where more frequent demonstrations in recent years are pressuring the decades-long dynastic government. Here’s what to know about the current political situation in Togo: Large demonstrations have been held in Lome in recent years, with Togolese calling for Gnassingbe, who has led the country since 2005, to step down. Between 2017 and 2018, thousands of protesters took to the streets in demonstrations tagged “Faure Must Go” and “Togo stands up”. The uprising rocked the nation of four million and resulted in violent crackdowns from security officials. The government thereafter banned public demonstrations for “security reasons”. Although officially a democracy, Togo operates in practice as a militarised state, with the army heavily involved in politics. The capital is crawling with stern-faced, armed gendarmes who are often accused of arresting and torturing dissidents. This year’s bout of protests was triggered after popular rapper and TikToker Tchala Essowe Narcisse, popularly known as Aamron, was arrested for publishing a video where he called for protests to mark the president’s June 6 birthday. However, anger had been simmering over the high costs of living in the country, and particularly, over new constitutional reforms that opposition leaders and civil society organisations say could see Gnassingbe rule for life. Thursday’s municipal elections will be the first polls held under the new reforms. Firstapprovedin April 2024 by a parliament dominated by the governing Union pour le Republic (UNIR) party, the constitutional amendment swapped the presidential system in the country for a parliamentary one. Controversially, though, it also introduced a new all-powerful position: President of the Council of Ministers. The role essentially regains all the powers of a president and is without clear official limits. Opposition leaders argued at the time that it would allow Gnassingbe to appoint a dummy president and remain the de facto leader until at least 2030. They called it a “constitutional coup”. On May 3 this year, Gnassingbe was sworn into the new executive role, as critics predicted. Politician Jean-Lucien Savi de Tove, 86, is now president, and is the oldest in Togo’s history. In late June, thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of Lome in anger, calling for Gnassingbe to step down from office after rapper Aamron’s arrest and alleged torture. Protesters set up barricades and hurled stones at security forces, who responded with force, firing tear gas canisters into the crowd, according to reporting by the Reuters news agency. Le Front Citoyen Togo Debout, a coalition of 12 civil society and human rights groups, accused security officials of arbitrarily arresting civilians, beating them with batons and ropes, and stealing and destroying private property. At least seven people were discovered dead in the aftermath of the protests, according to the coalition, including two minors. Their bodies were discovered days after the demonstrations in various lagoons and lakes around Lome. Meanwhile, a Togolese government statement said the deaths were caused by drowning and cautioned residents living near water bodies to be extra careful in the current rainy season. The‘Don’t Touch My Constitution’movement demanded an international investigation into the claims, while Togo’s Catholic Bishops said the levels of violence were “unacceptable and unjustified”. Just days after his father died in 2005, Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe was hurriedly installed as the country’s president by the army, extending decades of his family’s rule over Togo. Despite outrage in the country, which led to widespread protests in which at least 500 people were killed, the younger Gnassingbe did not relinquish power and went on to organise and win elections that year, which many critics called a ruse. His father, the late Gnassingbe Eyadema, seized power in a military coup and ruled the country with a tight fist for 38 years (1967-2005), making him the longest-serving African ruler at the time he died. His “rule of terror” was characterised by a one-party system and deadly repression of dissent,accordingto Amnesty International. The younger Gnassingbe, while having fostered multi-party rule and infrastructural development in the country, appears to be angling for his father’s record, critics say. Combined, the father-son duo has commandeered Togo for 58 years. With 60 percent of the population under 35, most Togolese have never experienced life under a different political administration. Gnassingbe has won every election since 2005. In 2019, in an attempt to circumvent demonstrations calling for his resignation, parliamentushered inconstitutional amendments that, the government argued, automatically reset Gnassingbe’s terms. That allowed him to run for the 2020 and 2025 presidential elections. At first glance, the latest reforms from 2024 appear to acquiesce to what some critics have been demanding: A weakened president elected by the parliament for a single six-year term, rather than an all-powerful leader. However, what most did not see coming was that Gnassingbe would be appointed to a more powerful position. As tensions simmer, demonstrators and civil society accuse Togolese officials of targeting protest leaders, many of whom are living in exile in neighbouring countries, as well as France and the United States. Last week, the government issued international arrest warrants targeting those believed to be leading organisers, especially members of the M66 Citizens’ Movement – a political collective of bloggers and activists, named after Gnassingbe’s June 6 birthday date. Officials say the group is “inciting unrest and terrorism” in the country. “The countries where these individuals reside are urged to cooperate,” Security Minister Calixte Madjoulba said at a news briefing. “Wherever they are, we will pursue them.” M66 members called for renewed protests on July 16 and 17 in a bid to boycott the municipal elections, which form part of a wider push by the government to devolve power at the centre and attempt to improve local governance. Local elections were not held between 1986 and 2020, as the government kept postponing them. Instead, the central authorities designated special administrators who critics say served the government’s interests. Some opposition leaders have also called for boycotts, although Jean-Pierre Fabre, leader of the main opposition National Alliance for Change, told reporters this week that taking part in the vote was necessary to show Togolese what’s possible. “The elections will not change anything in this country and we know it very well,” Zaga Bambo, a France-based music artist who claims to be a member of the group, said in a Facebook post. Bambo also dismissed the arrest warrants, telling French media channel RFI that he was unfazed by it. Activist Farida Nabourema echoed calls for boycotts on social media platform X. “You participate, you lose, you cry out, then you fall silent. And every five years, you start over,” she wrote."
"After 20-year fight, Israel to expel Masafer Yatta Palestinians from homes",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/10/west-bank-palestinians-prepare-to-lose-homes-as-israel-pushes-for-expulsion,,"Israeli soldiers bound Mohamed Yousef’s hands behind his back as they dragged him to a military camp near the occupied West Bank’sMasafer Yatta, a collection of Palestinian villages in Hebron governorate, in late June. With him were his mother, his wife and two sisters, arrested on their land for confronting armed Israeli settlers. Settlers often graze their animals on Palestinian land to assert control, signal unrestricted access and lay the groundwork for establishingillegal outposts, cutting Palestinians off from their farms and livestock. Yousef knew this, so he went out to defend his farm when he saw the armed settlers. But as is often the case, it was Mohamed, a Palestinian, who was punished. At the military camp, he was left with his family in the scorching sun for hours. While Mohamed and his family were released the next day, they fear they will not have the means to defend themselves for much longer. “The police, the [Israeli] army and settlers often attack us all at once. What are we supposed to do?” Yousef said. The Israeli military did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the incident.    Things might be about to get worse for Yousef and his family, who, along with about 1,200 other Palestinians, could soon be expelled from their lands. On June 17, during the zenith of Israel’s war on Iran, the Israeli government submitted a letter, a copy of which has been seen by Al Jazeera, to the Israeli High Court of Justice that included a request by the army to demolish at least 12 villages in Masafer Yatta and expel the inhabitants. The Israeli army argued that it has to demolish the villages to convert the area into a military “firing” or training zone, according to Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups. However, a 2015studyby Kerem Novat, an Israeli civil society organisation, found that such justifications are a ruse to seize Palestinian land. From the time Israel occupied swaths of the West Bank in the 1967 war, it has converted about one-third of the West Bank into a “closed military zone”, according to the study. And yet, military drills have never been carried out in 80 percent of these zones after Palestinians were dispossessed of their homes. The study concluded that the military confiscates Palestinian land as a strategy to “reduce the Palestinian population’s ability to use the land and to transfer as much of it as possible to Israeli settlers”. Yousef fears his village could suffer a similar fate following the state’s petition to the High Court. “I have no idea what’s going to happen to us,” Mohamed told Al Jazeera. “Even if we are forced to leave, then where are we supposed to go? Where will we live?” Many fear the Israeli High Court will side with the army and evict all Palestinians from “Firing Zone 918”, a battle that has been ongoing for decades. Israeli courts have played a central role in rubber-stamping Israel’s policies in the occupied West Bank, described as apartheid by many, by approving the demolition of entire Palestinian communities, according to Amnesty International. The communities currently at risk were first handed an eviction notice and expelled in 1999, and told that their villages had been declared a military training zone, which the army dubbed “Firing Zone 918”. The army claimed that the herding communities living in this “zone” were not “permanent residents”, despite thecommunities saying they lived therelong before the state of Israel was formed by ethnically cleansing Palestinians in 1948, an event known as the Nakba.    With little recourse other than navigating an unfriendly Israeli legal system to resist their dispossession, the communities and human rights lawyers representing them initiated a legal battle to stop the evictions in Israeli district courts and the High Court. In 2000, a judge ordered the army to allow the communities to return to their villages until a final ruling was issued. Human rights lawyers have since filed countless petitions and appeals to delay and hinder the army’s attempt to expel the villagers. “The [Israelis]…have been trying to expel us for decades,” said 63-year-old Nidal Younis, the head of the Masafer Yatta Council. Then, in May 2022, the High Court ordered the expulsion of eight Masafer Yatta villages. The court ruled that the inhabitants were not “permanent residents”, ignoring evidence that the defence provided. “We brought [the court] artefacts, photo analyses and ancient tools, used by the families for decades, that were representative of permanent residence,” said Netta Amar-Shiff, one of the lawyers representing the villagers. “But the court dismissed all the evidence we brought as irrelevant.” Amar-Shiff and her colleagues filed another case in early 2023 to argue that military drills must, at the very least, not result in the demolition of Palestinian villages or the expulsion of inhabitants in the area. The legal battle, and others, is now being upended by the Israeli army and government’s request to evict and demolish all the villages in the desired military zone, said Amar-Shiff. In an attempt to fast-track that request, the Civil Planning Bureau, an Israeli military body responsible for building permits, issued a decree on June 18 to reject all pending Palestinian building requests in “Firing Zone 918”. The United Nations and Israeli human rights groups have been notified of the new decree, although it has not been published on any government website. Across Israel and the occupied West Bank, Palestinians and Israelis need to obtain building permits from Israeli authorities to build and live in any structure. According to the Israeli human rights group Bimkom, Palestinians in Area C, the largest ofthree zonesin the occupied West Bank that were created out of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, are practically always denied permits, while permits for Israeli settlers are almost always approved. Palestinians in Masafer Yatta still submitted many building requests, hoping the administrative process would delay the demolition of their homes. However, the Central Planning Bureau’s recent decree, issued to align with the army’s prior announcement, supersedes all these pending requests and paves the way for an outright rejection of all of them, facilitating more ethnic cleansing, according to activists, lawyers and human rights groups. Once the decree is published, lawyers representing Palestinians from “Firing Zone 918” will have to go to the High Court for a final and definitive ruling, which is expected within a few months. “There are many judges in the High Court who will either dismiss this case on its face or not order the army to stop demolitions until they rule,” Amar-Shiff told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, settlers and Israeli troops are escalating attacks against Palestinians living in the area. Sami Hourani, a researcher from Masafer Yatta for Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organisation, said the Israeli army has confiscated dozens of cars since declaring its intent to ethnically cleanse the villages. He added that the army is arresting solidarity activists trying to visit the area, as well as helping settlers to attack and expel Palestinians. “We are in an isolation stage now,” Hourani told Al Jazeera, adding that the villages in Masafer Yatta are under siege and cut off from the outside world. “We are expecting the army to carry out massive demolitions at any moment.”"
How were identities of thousands of Afghans leaked by UK military?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/how-were-identities-of-thousands-of-afghan-refugees-leaked-by-uk-military,,"The British government hassecretly resettled thousands of Afghansin the United Kingdom for fear they might be targeted by the Taliban after their personal details were leaked, Defence Secretary John Healey revealed on Tuesday. Details about the accidental data breach by a British soldier and the secret relocation programme for Afghans were made public after a rare court order known as a “superinjuction”, which barred the media from even disclosing its existence, was lifted on Tuesday. Here is what we know about what happened and how the government responded: A spreadsheet containing the personal information of about 18,700 Afghans and their relatives – a total of about 33,000 people – was accidentally forwarded to the wrong recipients by email in February 2022, Healey told lawmakers in the House of Commons. These were people who had applied for relocation to the UK between August 2021 and January 7, 2022. That was the six-month period following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan after the US and allied forces withdrew from the country. Most had worked as translators, assistants or in other capacities for the British military in Afghanistan. They had applied for the UK’s Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme, which, like its predecessor, the Ex-Gratia Scheme (EGS), had been set up for Afghans who had worked for the British forces. The EGS was originally established in 2013 following a long campaign by activists and media in support of people who had assisted the British military in Afghanistan and who were considered likely to face reprisals from the Taliban. The British soldier at the centre of the leak, who had been tasked with verifying applications for relocation, is understood to have mistakenly believed the database contained the names of 150 applicants, when it actually contained personal information linked to some 18,714 people. The soldier was under the command of General Sir Gwyn Jenkins, who was director of special forces at the time and now heads the British Navy. His name had also been suppressed by the court order until this week. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) became aware of the leak when someone else posted parts of the data on Facebook on August 14, 2023. The Facebook post was first spotted by an activist who was assisting Afghans who had worked with UK forces. The activist contacted the MoD, saying: “The Taliban may now have a 33,000-long kill list – essentially provided to them by the British government. If any of these families are murdered, the government will be liable,” The Guardian newspaper reported.    The MoD told Facebook to take down the post with the leaked information, citing security threats from the Taliban. It also warned some 1,800 ARAP applicants who had fled to Pakistan that they or their families could be in danger. The UK government, led by former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, then sought a court order barring any media disclosure of the data breach. On September 1, 2023, a High Court judge in London issued a “superinjunction”, which not only prohibits the disclosure of any details but also forbids revealing that the order exists at all. That superinjunction was lifted on Tuesday following a campaign led by The Times newspaper in London. In April 2024, the government created the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) to support Afghans who were not eligible for ARAP but were considered at high risk of reprisals from the Taliban as a result of the data leak. This scheme, which was kept secret, has now been closed, Healey told the House of Commons. However, he added that hundreds of invitations were issued to Afghans and their families under the scheme and these invitations “will be honoured”. The government also launched the secret Operation Rubific to evacuate those Afghans deemed to be at risk directly to the UK. As a direct result of the leak, the government says 900 people and about 3,000 relatives have already been flown to the UK under the secret relocation scheme and put up in hotels or military bases. In total, about 24,000 Afghans affected by the breach have either been brought to the UK already or will be in the near future, according to UK media reports. Through broader resettlement schemes, 35,245 Afghans have so far been relocated to the UK, official data suggests. The court order barring the details about the leak from being disclosed was lifted at noon (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Following several private hearings, a High Court judge ruled in May that the injunction should be lifted, citing, among other reasons, the inability of the public or parliament to scrutinise the government’s decisions. British news outlet The Times reported it had spearheaded the two-year legal battle which resulted in the injunction being lifted. That decision was, however, overturned by the Court of Appeal in July 2024, due to concerns about the potential risks to individuals whose information had been leaked. Then came the “Rimmer review”. Healey, a member of current Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ruling Labour party, said he was briefed about the leak when it happened as he was serving as shadow defence secretary at the time. However, he added that other cabinet members were only informed about the leak when Starmer’s party was elected to power in the general election of July 2024. “As Parliamentarians – and as Government Ministers – it has been deeply uncomfortable to be constrained in reporting to this House. And I am grateful today to be able to disclose the details to Parliament,” Healey said on Tuesday. Healey said that at the beginning of this year, he commissioned former senior civil servant and former Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence Paul Rimmer to conduct an independent review. Quoting the “Rimmer review” in Parliament on Tuesday, Healey said that four years since the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan, “there is little evidence of intent by the Taleban [sic] to conduct a campaign of retribution against former officials.” He added that the information the Taliban inherited from the former Afghan government would have already allowed them to target individuals if they had wished. Therefore, Rimmer concluded it was “highly unlikely” that someone’s information being on the leaked spreadsheet would be a key piece of information enabling or prompting the Taliban to take action. “However, Rimmer is clear – he stresses the uncertainty in any judgements … and he does not rule out any risk,” Healey said. The Times reported that after the superinjunction had been lifted, a new temporary court order was issued, barring the media from publishing specific sensitive details about what exactly was in the database. The Times said the government cited reasons of confidentiality and national security, arguing that the leaked list still poses a threat to the safety of the Afghans. In awebpagepublished on Tuesday, the MoD states: “At present, there is no evidence to suggest that the spreadsheet has been seen or used by others who might seek to exploit the information; however, the UK Government cannot rule out that possibility.” It now advises those who applied for the ARAP or EGS programmes before January 7, 2022, to exercise caution, avoid phone calls or messages from unknown numbers, limit their social media profiles and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) where possible. UK-based media outlets have reported that a law firm is suing the MoD on behalf of at least 1,000 Afghans affected by the data leak. Healey said on Tuesday that it had already cost 400 million pounds ($540m) to bring an initial 900 Afghans and their 3,600 family members to the UK under the ARR. However, this does not account for the expenditures by other government schemes to relocate Afghans to the UK. Healey estimated that the total cost of relocating Afghans to the UK was between 5.5 billion and 6 billion pounds ($7.4bn to $8bn). Different figures for how much the leak cost the UK have emerged. An unnamed government official told Reuters that the leak cost the UK about 2 billion pounds ($2.7bn). Other outlets have reported that ARR is expected to cost the UK government a total of 850 million pounds ($1.1bn)."
Former colonial ruler France hands over its last military bases in Senegal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/former-colonial-ruler-france-hands-over-its-last-military-bases-in-senegal,,"France has officially handed over its two remaining military bases in Senegal, leaving the onetime colonial power with no permanent presence in either West or Central Africa. France returned Camp Geille, its largest base in Senegal, and its airfield at Dakar’s airport in a ceremony on Thursday attended by top French and Senegalese officials, including Senegalese Chief of the General Staff Mbaye Cisse and General Pascal Ianni, the head of the French forces in Africa. The pullout ends the French army’s 65-year presence in Senegal and comes after similar withdrawals across the continent as former colonies increasingly turn their backs on the nation that once ruled them. France’s withdrawal from Senegal also comes as the Sahel region faces a growing conflict. The violence across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger is threatening Gulf of Guinea nations to the south. About 350 French soldiers, who had primarily been tasked with conducting joint operations with the Senegalese army, are now leaving the country, marking the end of a departure process that began in March. General Cisse said the handover marked “an important turning point in the rich and long military journey of our two countries”. France is “reinventing partnerships in a dynamic Africa”, Ianni said. “We are turning a page in the military history of our two countries, … a very special relationship and one essential for the countries of the region.” Afterstorming to victoryin elections last year by promising dramatic change, Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Fayedemanded France withdraw its soldiersby 2025. However, unlike the leaders of other former French colonies such as Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, which are run by military governments, Faye has insisted that Senegal will keep working with Paris. After gaining independence in 1960, Senegal became one of France’s staunchest African allies, playing host to French troops throughout its history. Faye has also urged France to apologise for colonial atrocities, including themassacre on December 1, 1944, of dozens of African troops who had fought for France in World War II. With governments across Africa increasingly questioning France’s military presence, Paris has closed or reduced the numbers of its soldiers at bases across its former empire. In February, France handed back its sole remaining base in Ivory Coast,ending decades of French presence there. The month before, France turned over the Kossei base in Chad, its last military foothold in the Sahel region. Coups in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali from 2020 to 2023 have swept military strongmen to power. Their governments have collectively ejected 4,300 French soldiers. All three countries have cut ties with France and turned to Russia instead for help in fighting the Sahel’s decade-long unrest. The Central African Republic, also a former French colony to which the Kremlin has sent mercenaries, has likewise demanded a French pullout. Meanwhile, the French army has turned its base in Gabon into a camp shared with its Central African host. Only the tiny Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti will be home to a permanent French army base after Thursday’s withdrawal. France intends to make that base with about 1,500 people its military headquarters for Africa."
"Brazil police raid former president Jair Bolsonaro’s home, headquarters",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/brazil-police-raid-former-president-jair-bolsonaros-home-headquarters,,"Federal police have raided the home and headquarters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, according to multiple reports. Police in a statement on Friday said they had issued search warrants ordered by the country’s Supreme Court, but did not name Bolsonaro, who governed Latin America’s largest country from 2019 to 2022. Bolsonaro is currently on trial before Brazil’s Supreme Court on charges of plotting to stop President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in January 2023 following his election loss. Local media also reported that Bolsonaro had been ordered to wear an ankle bracelet, stop using social media and cease communications with his son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker who has been lobbying in Washington, DC on behalf of his father. The search comes as US President Donald Trump, whose supporters also sought to overturn his election loss in January 2021, has threatened Brazil with 50 percent tariffs on Brazilian goods if Bolsonaro was not granted legal reprieve.

Israel bombed Syria with “no real consultation”,https://www.aljazeera.com/video/quotable/2025/7/18/israel-bombed-syria-with-no-real,,Political analyst Akiva Eldar talks about Israel’s strike on Damascus – framed as protecting Syria’s Druze community – but says the government acted without proper consideration.
Not just about the Druze: Israel’s rationale for its attacks on Syria,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/not-just-about-the-druze-israels-rationale-for-its-attacks-on-syria,,"On Wednesday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video message to his country’s Druze minority. He implored them not to cross into southwestern Syria to support Syrian Druze militiamen in their fight against local Bedouin and government forces in Suwayda. And yet, as Netanyahu made the statement, his own forces were bombing the Syrian capital Damascus, hitting the country’s Ministry of Defence, and killing at least three people. Netanyahu claimed that he had deployed Israel’s military might in the defence of the Druze. “My brothers, the Druze citizens of Israel, the situation in Suweyda in southwestern Syria is very serious,” the principal architect of the2018 nation-state lawthat’s been widely criticised for marginalising the Druze and other minorities said. “We are acting to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime,” he assured them, referring to the Syrian government.    Sectarian tensions betweenthe Druzeand local Bedouins in Suweyda are longstanding. Meanwhile, attempts by the newly formed Syrian government, which took power after the fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, to assert control over the regionhave been frustrated in part by Israel’srepeated threats against the presence of the Syrian military near its border. There are roughly 700,000 Druze in Syria. Another 150,000 Druze live in Israel, where, at least before the 2018 law emphasising only Jewish self-determination, many regarded themselves as bound by a “blood covenant” with their Jewish neighbours since 1948 and the founding of Israel at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed inthe Nakba. While some now feel like “second-class” citizens, the majority are still supportive of the Israeli state, where they serve in the military. “The Israeli Druze see themselves as Druze, as Israelis, and as Arabs,” Rami Zeedan, an associate professor at the University of Kansas and the founder and editor-in-chief of Druze Studies Journal, said. “Part of the identification with Israel is the feeling of both Jews and Druze being persecuted minorities,” he added. “Israeli Druze still feel that they have much more to gain from Israel compared to any other hypothetical future. As a cornerstone of this alliance is the protection of the Druze community.” “The Israeli Druze are now trying to use that and urge the Israeli government to protect fellow Druze in Syria,” he said, explaining, in part, the justification for Israel’s strikes on Syria, where the Druze community has traditionally been anti-Israel, even as some leaders grow closer to Israel.    But the reality is that Israel has long attacked Syria, even before the latest outbreak of violence involving the Druze in Suwayda. Since the ousting of al-Assad after a 14-year war, Israel has struck Syria hundreds of times and invaded and occupied about 400 square kilometres (155sq miles) of its territory, excluding the western Golan Heights, which it has occupied since 1967. Leading analysts within Israel suggest that these latest attacks may not have been entirely motivated by concern for the welfare of the Druze, so much as the personal and political aims of the Israeli government and its embattled prime minister. “It’s pure opportunism,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera. “Of course, it’s nice to pretend that we’re helping our friends the Druze, in the same way as we never helped our other friends, the Kurds,” he said, referring to another regional ethnic group. Pinkas sketched out a number of the motivations behind Israel’s recent strikes on Syria, from boosting Netanyahu’s newfound self-image as a wartime leader, to pushing back hiscorruption trial, to reinforcing the “delusion” that, over the previous 21 months, Israel has somehow managed to reshape the Middle East through military force alone. “Lastly, he doesn’t want to see a unified Syria with a strong central government controlled by al-Sharaa,” Pinkas said. “He wants a weak central government dealing with areas controlled by the Kurds [in the north] and the Druze and Bedouin in the south.” “Basically, if Syria remains un-unified, Israel can do what it wants in its south,” he added. Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasised that Israel will only stand for a demilitarised Syria south of Damascus, including the region that encompasses Suwayda. This, in effect, creates a buffer zone for Israel, adding to the military reasoning for Israel’s actions in Syria.    The attacks on Syria have the additional effect of sustaining the sense of crisis that has gripped Israeli society and sustained its government through numerous scandalssince the Hamas-led attackof October 7, 2023, and the subsequent war on Gaza. Israel has since attacked Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and Syria. “It’s not that people are tired of war; it’s like they no longer even care. It’s ennui,” Israeli political analyst Ori Goldberg said of the public response to the latest attacks. “War gives people energy and meaning, but it’s fleeting. People have even forgotten about the war with Iran,” he said, referring to the 12-day war in June that prompted global fears of regional escalation. All the caveats and cautions that would normally precede military action had, Goldberg noted, been replaced by ever-fresh dangers requiring new escalations. “It’s dangerous,” he said. “Israelis don’t care about the Druze. It’s just a new threat, a new front, and now there’s this tired, ‘OK, dude. Let’s do it [attitude]’.” “War has hollowed us out.”"

What happened to the fuel-control switches on doomed Air India flight 171?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/what-happened-to-the-fuel-control-switches-on-doomed-air-india-flight-171,,"New details about last month’s Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, which killed 260 people, have emerged this week, shifting focus onto the actions of the senior pilot during the last moments before the plane crashed. According to a report published on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal quoting sources close to United States officials’ early assessment of evidence, the black box audio recording of the last conversation between the two pilots indicates that the captain might have turned off the switches controlling the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines. Last week, apreliminary reportby India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that both engines had shut down within the space of one second, leading to immediate loss of altitude, before the plane crashed into a densely populated suburb of Ahmedabad. However, that report, which stated the fuel-control switches had moved to the “cutoff” position, did not assign blame for the incident. Two groups of commercial pilots haverejectedsuggestions that human error may have caused the disaster. At 1:38pm (08:08 GMT) on June 12, Air India Flight 171 took off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad for London Gatwick Airport, carrying 230 passengers, 10 cabin crew and two pilots. About 40 seconds after taking off, both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner lost power during the initial climb. The plane then crashed into the BJ Medical College Hostel in a populated suburb 1.85km (1.15 miles) from the runway. The aircraft broke apart on impact, causing a fire that destroyed parts of five buildings. All the passengers on the plane died except one – Vishwaskumar Ramesh, a 40-year-old British national of Indian origin. Some 19 people on the ground were killed as well, and 67 were injured. The AAIB is investigating the crash, the deadliest aviation incident in a decade, along with Boeing and experts from the US and United Kingdom. A preliminary report from the investigators released on Saturday found the aircraft had been deemed airworthy, had up-to-date maintenance and carried no hazardous cargo. But the report noted that a 2018 US Federal Aviation Administration advisory warned of a potential flaw in the fuel-control switch system of some Boeing planes, including the Dreamliner. The report said Air India did not inspect the system and it was not mandatory for it to do so. During the crash, recovery systems activated, but only partial engine relight occurred, the report stated. Both engines shut down just after takeoff as fuel switches moved from the “run” to “cutoff” positions. The report cited a black box audio recording in which one pilot asked, “Why did you cut off?” and the other denied doing so. The speakers were not identified. Despite taking emergency measures, only one engine partially restarted, and moments before impact, a “Mayday” call was issued before communications were lost. Air traffic control received no response after the distress call but saw the aircraft crash outside the boundary of the airport. CCTV footage from the airport showed one of the flight recovery systems – known as the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) – deploying shortly after liftoff, followed by a rapid descent.    Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, served as the pilot-in-command on the flight. A soft-spoken veteran who had logged more than 15,600 flight hours, 8,500 of them on the Boeing 787, Sabharwal was known for his reserved nature, meticulous habits and mentorship of junior pilots. He trained at India’s premier aviation school, the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, and friends who spoke to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recalled him as deeply committed to his career as a pilot as well as caring for his ageing father, a former civil aviation official. First Officer Clive Kunder, 32, was the pilot flying the aircraft at the time of the crash while Sabharwal was the pilot monitoring. Kunder had accumulated more than 3,400 flying hours, including 1,128 hours on the Dreamliner. Flying was his childhood dream, inspired by his mother’s 30-year career as an Air India flight attendant. At age 19, he trained in the US and earned a commercial pilot’s licence before returning to India to join Air India in 2017. Described by family and friends in the WSJ as joyful, curious and tech-savvy, Kunder was said to be passionate about aviation and excited to be flying the 787. According to US officials who examined evidence from the crash and were quoted by the WSJ, the cockpit voice recording suggests it was Sabharwal who may have moved the fuel control switches to “cutoff” after takeoff, an action that cut power to both engines. The switches were turned back on within seconds, but it was too late to regain full thrust. As the flying pilot, Kunder would have been occupied with the climb-out, making it unlikely he could have manipulated the switches, according to unnamed US pilots quoted by the WSJ. Sabharwal, as the monitoring pilot, would have had a freer hand, they said. Located on a key cockpit panel just behind the throttle levers between the two pilot seats, these switches manage the flow of fuel to each of the aircraft’s two engines. Pilots use these fuel cutoff switches to start or shut down the engines while on the ground. In flight, the pilots can manually shut down or restart an engine in the event of a failure. The switches are designed for manual operation. They are spring-loaded to stay firmly in place and cannot be moved accidentally or with light pressure during flight operations. The switches have two settings: “cutoff” and “run”. The “cutoff” mode stops fuel from reaching the engines while “run” allows normal fuel flow. To change positions, a pilot must first pull the switch upwards before shifting it between “run” and “cutoff”. Experts are cautious about this. US aviation analyst Mary Schiavo told the Financial Express in India that people should not draw premature conclusions, arguing that there is as yet no definitive evidence of pilot error. She highlighted a similar incident during which one of the engines suddenly shut down midflight on an All Nippon Airways Boeing 787 during its final approach to Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Investigators later found that the aircraft’s software had mistakenly interpreted the plane as being on the ground, triggering the thrust control malfunction accommodation system, which automatically moved the fuel switch from “run” to “cutoff” without any action from the pilots. Schiavo warned that a similar malfunction cannot yet be ruled out in the Air India crash and stressed the importance of releasing the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript to avoid misleading interpretations. “There is nothing here to suggest pilot suicide or murder,” she said. “The voices, words and sounds on CVRs must be carefully analysed.” India’s Federation of Indian Pilots criticised the framing of the preliminary findings in the media this week. In a public statement, the federation noted that the report relies heavily on paraphrased CVR excerpts and lacks comprehensive data. “Assigning blame before a transparent, data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible,”  the statement read before adding that it undermines the professionalism of the crew and causes undue distress to their families. Campbell Wilson, chief executive of Air India, this week urged staff not to make premature conclusions about the causes of the crash, telling them this week that the investigation was “far from over”."
Uber to invest in $300m in EV maker Lucid amid robotaxi deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/17/uber-to-invest-in-300m-in-ev-maker-lucid-amid-robotaxi-deal,,"Uber will invest $300m in electric vehicle maker Lucid in a robotaxi deal that aims to start with one major US city late next year. The two companies announced the new partnership on Thursday. Over six years starting in 2026, Uber will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology from startup Nuro, the three companies said in a statement. The agreement illustrates the renewed plans and push for financing for self-driving cabs, years after a first wave of autonomous driving investment produced only a limited number of vehicles. Tesla has recently launched a robotaxi trial in Austin, and Alphabet’s driverless taxi unit, Waymo, is speeding up its expansion. As part of their announced deal, Uber will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Lucid and Nuro, which supply self-driving technology to carmakers, the joint statement said. Of that, $300m will go to Lucid, the EV maker said in a separate filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Lucid shares surged about 39 percent as of 11:15am in New York (15:15 GMT). They had fallen about 24 percent this year.    Uber’s latest move underscores its renewed push into the robotaxi space after exiting in 2020. Since then, Uber has pivoted to partnerships with several technology developers, including Waymo and Aurora. The deal with Lucid follows Uber’s robotaxi agreement in April with Volkswagen, which will supply its ID.Buzz vans for commercial service, planned for Los Angeles next year. But commercialising AV tech has been much harder than anticipated, with high costs, tight regulations and federal investigations forcing many, including General Motors’ Cruise, to shut down. Some still in the race include Amazon.com’s Zoox, which is testing a robotaxi without manual controls and plans to launch commercial services in Las Vegas this year.    After years of missed deadlines and unmet promises,Tesla started a restrictedtrial with about a dozen of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, last month. CEO Elon Musk has said it will expand the service rapidly to other US cities this year. Waymo has been growingcautiously for years and operates in several US cities with about 1,500 vehicles. It crossed 100 million miles of autonomous driving this month. A prototype of the Lucid-Nuro robotaxi is already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro’s testing facility in Las Vegas, the companies said. “We are expanding beyond our traditional EV technology leadership and working on partnerships and going now into areas that in the past we have not really focused on,” Lucid’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff told the Reuters news agency. Nuro, cofounded and led by former Waymo engineers, has expanded from making last-mile delivery vehicles to providing its self-driving technology for commercial and passenger vehicles. “We have other very active conversations going on the personal vehicle side … where we would integrate Nuro driver into vehicles that will get sold to end consumers,” Dave Ferguson, Nuro’s cofounder and president, said. Nuro will still need to apply for state-level operating licences, though it holds some licences from its previous delivery operations, he said. Separately, Lucid said it had proposed a one-for-10 reverse stock split of its class A common stock. While Lucid stock was up 39 percent, Uber’s stock, on the other hand, was trending downward at 0.1 percent from the market open."
Why is Pakistan so vulnerable to deadly flooding?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/why-is-pakistan-so-vulnerable-to-deadly-flooding,,"Islamabad, Pakistan –More than 120 people have died in Pakistan due to climate-related incidents in the past three weeks, as the country braces for the onset of the monsoon season. In its latestsituation report, released on Wednesday, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed that a total of 124 people, including 63 children, have perished across the country since June 26. The NDMA has found that about two-thirds of thedeathswere caused by house collapses and flash floods, whiledrowningaccounted for just more than one in 10 of the deaths. Pakistan, which has a population in excess of 250 million, is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. It has experienced repeated environmental disasters, most notably the devastatingfloods of 2022,which killed nearly 1,700 people and displaced more than 30 million nationwide, who lost their homes and livestock or suffered crop damage or losses. According to estimates at the time, the 2022 floods caused $14.8bn in damage to property and land and a loss of $15.2bn in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Pakistan’s government blames the lack of assistance from the international community in urgently addressing the climate emergency, which is causing flash floods and other disasters. However, some experts say the government’s inaction has compounded the current situation. The latest figures from the NDMA show that the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa suffered the most deaths, with 49 and 38, respectively, since June 24. Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, saw heavy, intermittent rains last week which left several low-lying areas in the city without electricity and resulted in severe waterlogging of the city’s narrow streets. Other areas in central and southern Punjab also suffered heavy rainfall, with the country’s meteorological department predicting further rain in the coming days. Similarly, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where at least nine people of one familydrowned in Swat Riverwhile having a picnic last month, also faced heavy rain in various areas. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned that another strong monsoon weather system will hit most parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the next few days, while Punjab is expected to receive heavy showers. An NDMA official, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media, told Al Jazeera that, according to weather forecasting, the authority is not expecting a repeat of 2022-like “large-scale riverine floods at this stage”. But the official added that localised flash floods and urban flooding remain a significant concern across the country. “The NDMA has issued early warnings and advisories to provincial authorities and the public and has pre-positioned critical relief supplies at vulnerable locations. We continue to monitor the situation through satellite-based systems, weather models, and real-time ground reporting,” the official added.    South Asian nations, including Pakistan, typically receive 70 to 80 percent of their annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which lasts from late June to September. This year, damage caused by monsoons is compounded by extreme heat in the country’s northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, dubbed the “third pole” as it is home to many of the world’s importantglaciers. According to the PMD, parts of the mountainous region recorded temperatures above 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit), despite being situated at least 1,200 metres (4,000ft) above sea level. Gilgit-Baltistan is home to thousands of glaciers and attracts climbers from across the globe. A study last year by Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change and the Italian research institute EvK2CNR estimated that thecountry hostsmore than 13,000 glaciers. Excessive heat has accelerated the melting of these glaciers this year, heightening the risk of floods and infrastructure damage, as well as posing a severe threat to life, land and water security. Sitara Parveen, an environmentalist and assistant professor at Fatima Jinnah Degree College in Gilgit, said the June heatwave triggered rapid glacial melting, with temperatures in some areas breaking nearly three-decade records. “However, risk of floods with monsoon is high, considering the evidence from ‘Little Ice Age’, where precipitation remained high with high temperature and there was less precipitation with low temperature,” Parveen told Al Jazeera. The “Little Ice Age” was a period of regional cooling, primarily affecting the North Atlantic, from the early 14th to the mid-19th centuries. Zakir Hussein, director general for Gilgit Baltistan’s disaster management authority, told Al Jazeera: “Given the rise in temperatures and anthropogenic climate change, the fragile ecosystem in Gilgit Baltistan is facing imminent flash flooding and risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) – a type of flood caused by the sudden release of water from a glacial lake.”    Pakistan says the international community is not doing enough to help. In 2023, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres argued that the international community is obligated to provide assistance, as Pakistan is responsible for only half a percent of global greenhouse emissions but its people are15 times more likely to diefrom climate-related disasters. Following the 2022 floods, Pakistan hosted a global donor conference with support from the UN in January 2023, at which approximately $10bn was pledged by donor nations – albeit much in the form of loans. But by 2024, Pakistan had received only $2.8bn of those pledges. Earlier this year, a former head of Pakistan’s central bank said the country would need annual investments of $40-50bn until 2050 toaddress its escalating climate challenges. However, while Pakistan faces genuine climate risks, some experts argue the crisis has been worsened by longstanding governance failures and poor policy decisions. In several recent incidents, civilian casualties in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were traced to the illegal construction of homes near riverbeds and flash floods sweeping away poorly built houses. A 2023 report by UN-Habitat, which promotes environmentally sustainable cities and towns, highlighted Pakistan’s problem of disorganised urban planning, revealing that rapid rural-to-urban migration has led to sprawling slums due to an acute housing shortage. “This unmet demand has led to over 50 percent of the urban population residing in slums or informal settlements known as katchi abadis,” the report stated. NDMA officials say the agency has taken a multi-tiered preparedness approach where the focus is not just on emergency response, but also risk reduction and early evacuation. “We have issued risk maps for vulnerable districts, and provincial governments are in the process of mobilising district administrations to identify and, where necessary, relocate communities at high risk, particularly those living near nullahs (watercourses), riverbanks and landslide-prone hills,” one official said. Pakistani climate experts say that while climate change is a serious concern, its effect has been compounded by institutional failures. “The damages and the loss you are seeing is a cost of inaction,” said Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, an Islamabad-based climate expert. He added that houses continue to be built in riverbeds in clear violation of the laws. “How is that the fault of monsoon rain?” Sheikh said Pakistan’s lack of urban planning and absence of preparedness have left people vulnerable to a variety of hazards, including riverine flooding, urban flooding and extreme heatwaves. “These are separate categories of challenges, and the scale of damage, both to people and infrastructure, varies because they have different dimensions of losses,” he said. Sheikh also criticised the government’s failure to implement meaningful climate reforms, highlighting that its response has been limited to securing foreign loans and launching projects without internal structural changes. “I cannot think of a single policy reform that the government has taken after the 2022 floods, despite all the tall claims made by the ministers and other officials. Internal-focused driven reforms to enhance the preparedness of communities in vulnerable areas is completely missing,” he said. “We are a reform-averse society, and we don’t want to undertake any change that is substantial in nature, and this attitude only perpetuates vulnerabilities.” Neither the NDMA nor the Ministry of Housing and Works responded to questions from Al Jazeera about these issues."
"Bangladesh police clash with pro-Hasina activists, at least three dead",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/bangladesh-police-clash-with-pro-hasina-activists-at-least-three-dead,,"Bangladeshi security forces clashed with supporters of deposed Prime MinisterSheikh Hasina, leaving at least three people dead and many injured. Violence broke out Wednesday in the southern town of Gopalganj when members of Hasina’s Awami League tried to disrupt a rally by the National Citizens Party (NCP), which is made up of students who spearheaded theunrestthat toppled the leader last year. TV footage showed pro-Hasina activists armed with sticks attacking police and setting vehicles on fire as NCP leaders arrived at the new party’s “March to Rebuild the Nation” programme commemorating the uprising. Monoj Baral, a nurse at the Gopalganj District Hospital, told the news agency AFP that three people were killed. Local media, including the English-language Daily Star, said that four had died. One of the dead was identified by Baral as Ramjan Sikdar. The other two were taken away from the hospital by their families, said Baral. Authorities imposed an overnight curfew in the district. Bangladesh’s interim leaderMuhammad Yunus, who replaced Hasina three days after her overthrow last year, said that the attempt by the former leader’s supporters to foil the NCP rally was “a shameful violation of their fundamental rights”. “This heinous act … will not go unpunished,” said a statement from the Nobel Peace Prize laureate’s office. Hasnat Abdullah, an NCP coordinator, said rally attendees took refuge at a police station after being attacked. “We don’t feel safe at all. They threatened to burn us alive,” he told AFP. Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since Hasina was toppled nearly a year ago. Hasina, who fled to India following a student-led uprising last August,faces several charges. This month, she wassentencedin absentia to six months in prison for contempt of court by the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).    Gopalganj is a politically sensitive district because the mausoleum of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is located there. Rahman, the country’s founding president, was buried there after he was assassinated along with most of his family members in a military coup in 1971. Hasina would go on to contest elections from the constituency. The NCP march was launched on July 1 across all districts in Bangladesh as part of its drive to position itself as a new force in Bangladeshi politics. The country’s political landscape has been largely dominated by two dynastic families: Hasina’s Awami League party and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Yunus has said an election will be held in April next year."
Israel is “undermining Syrian sovereignty”with “impunity”,https://www.aljazeera.com/video/quotable/2025/7/17/aje-onl-qt-alon-pinkas-170725,,
UN experts cast blame on Rwanda and Uganda. What are they doing in DRC?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/un-experts-cast-blame-on-rwanda-and-uganda-what-are-they-doing-in-drc,,"Kampala, Uganda –Rwanda is in “command and control” of M23 rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda has “unilaterally doubled its military presence” in the DRC, and armed groups – including those aligned to the Congolese government – are committing rights violations against civilians, according to a group of United Nations experts. An as-yet unpublished report from UN experts on DRC that was leaked to the media and seen by Al Jazeera describes violations by all parties to the conflict and blames neighbouring governments for allegedly exploiting and escalating the current crisis. The report was submitted to the UN Security Council in May, the Reuters news agency reported. It is expected to be released soon, a UN expert who contributed to the report told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, without specifying a date. While analysts see these reports as an essential tool of accountability, Kigali and Kampala have called the experts biased. Neither government replied to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about the contents of the report, but both have repeatedly denied the accusations levelled against them. Meanwhile, the new findings risk putting a damper on the cautious optimism garnered by the signing ofa peace dealbetween Rwanda and the DRC in the US last month, and ongoingQatar-mediatedpeace talks between Kinshasa and M23. For years, M23, which the UN says is backed by Rwanda – a charge Kigali denies – has been embroiled in conflict with the Congolese army and its allied militias known asWazalendo. Early this year, M23 made rapid advances, seizing control of Goma and Bukavu, the capitals of North Kivu and South Kivu, respectively, which it still holds today. The latest UN experts report – the first since M23’s advance – offers a stark assessment of the conflict, placing blame on Rwanda for facilitating the rapid expansion of the rebel forces. Rwanda is providing “critical support” to M23, which takes “instructions” from Rwanda’s government and intelligence services, said the report. In previous reports, the UN experts found there were some3,000-4,000Rwandan troops fighting alongside M23 in the DRC. “One week prior to the [M23] Goma attack, Rwandan officials confidentially informed the Group [of experts] that President Paul Kagame had decided to imminently take control of Goma and Bukavu,” the new report alleged. Rwanda has repeatedly denied backing M23,while Kigali has sharply criticised the UN experts. “These reports were written long ago,” President Paul Kagame said at a news conference in Kigali on July 4, after the contents of the report started circulating in international media. “They come here just to confirm a narrative they already had,” the Rwandan leader said about the UN panel of experts. Kagame likened the experts to an arsonist who torches a house but also acts as both judge and prosecutor. “The very ones who burned the [house] are the ones in the seat to judge and prosecute.” The report by UN experts, however, only reasserted its criticism of Kigali. The Rwandan army’s “de facto direction and effective control” over M23’s operations “render Rwanda liable for the actions” of the group, the report said, arguing that Rwanda’s conduct meets the threshold for international sanctions. Last month’s US-brokered deal between the DRC and Rwanda does not include M23, but it stipulates that all parties should comply with the Qatar peace process. It also highlights that the Congolese government should facilitate the disengagement of the armed group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which was established by Hutus linked to the killings of Tutsis in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Rwanda should then lift its “defensive measures” inside the DRC, the agreement said. While Kigali has often argued that its actions in theDRCare aimed at addressing longstanding security threats posed by the FDLR, the UN experts assert that its actions went far beyond legitimate security concerns. The experts noted that “the final objective of Kigali was to control the territory of the DRC and its natural resources.” Their report details how minerals, including coltan, were looted from mines in towns seized by M23, then smuggled into Rwanda. “Once in Rwanda, the looted minerals were mixed with local production, effectively laundering them into the downstream supply chain under the guise of Rwandan origin,” the report said. Part of the minerals smuggled to Rwanda were purchased byBoss Mining Solutions Inc, represented by Eddy Habimana, who has previously been implicated in the illegal trafficking of minerals from the DRC, the report added.    Beyond Rwanda, the report also outlines violations of international law by another neighbour,Uganda. Amid the Rwanda/M23–DRC fighting, there was a “rapid military build-up” by the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, the report said. Troops significantly increased this year “effectively doubling Uganda’s footprint in the country”, it added. The Ugandan army, which has conducted joint operations with the Congolese military against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel movement with origins in Uganda, since 2023,“unilaterally” increased its troop presence in eastern DRC, the report added. “The DRC government confirmed that the new UPDF deployment was executed without its prior approval, and that UPDF was undertaking unilateral initiatives outside the framework of joint operations with the [Congolese army],” the report read. The deployment, according to the panel of experts, raised questions about Kampala’s motives, particularly given past allegations of UPDF support to M23. While Uganda claimed the troop movements were defensive and aimed at securing its economic interests, the report says their positioning created a de facto buffer zone that shielded M23 from northern counterattacks. In response, Uganda’s ambassador to the UN, Adonia Ayebare, wrote on X that the report “contains falsehoods” and attempts to undermine the joint military operation with the DRC. He said Uganda will make an official statement after publication of the report. ​​General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Uganda’s army commander also posted on X, saying: “While the UN so called ‘Group of Experts’ writes biased reports against us, we (UPDF) continue to save the lives of human beings in our region.” The report by the UN experts had called out “repeated incendiary public statements” by Kainerugaba in which they said he emphasised close cooperation between the UPDF and the Rwandan army. The report also accused Thomas Lubanga, a former ICC convict living in Kampala, of forming a politico-military movement to oppose the Congolese government, “with at least moral and passive endorsement from the Ugandan authorities”. However, addressing journalists in Kampala on July 16, Lubanga said he is in forced exile because of persecution by Kinshasa, and if his movement had been receiving support from Uganda, it “would find itself on Kinshasa’s doorstep today”. Kristof Titeca, a professor at the University of Antwerp who recently published a report on Uganda’s operations in DRC, urges readers to view the UN report and the backlash it has provoked in the context of regional dynamics. Kigali and Kampala share overlapping interests in the DRC – chiefly concerning security, political influence, and economic access – but these interests also place them in a complex relationship of both cooperation and competition, he said. Titeca argues that the resurgence and rapid expansion of M23 was, in part, triggered by Kigali’s fear that Kampala might encroach on its influence in eastern DRC after Uganda allowed its soldiers to enter DRC in pursuit of the ADF. As M23 gained ground towards the end of 2024, Uganda reacted with troop deployments, particularly aimed at preventing the rebels – and by extension, Rwanda – from entering areas it sees as its sphere of interest. Titeca says the military manoeuvres were as much a strategic message to Rwanda as they were about protecting Ugandan interests. Drawing from movements and postures observed since late 2024, Titeca suggests that Kigali and Kampala may have an implicit understanding of their respective zones of influence. “Some people think there might be some agreement between Kampala and Kigali on their area of interest,” he said. In eastern DRC, “they are friends and also enemies at the same time,” he added, referring to Uganda and Rwanda.    For the UN experts, Kinshasa bears some responsibility, too. On the Congolese side, the report paints a picture of a state under siege, struggling to maintain sovereignty over its eastern territories. The government continued to rely heavily on irregular Wazalendo groups, and on the FDLR, despite the latter being under UN sanctions, as proxies in its fight against M23 and the Rwandan army. While strategic, the report says, this alliance has worsened the security and human rights situation, contributing to reprisal attacks, child recruitment and sexual violence. As it called out M23’s actions during the taking of Goma and Bukavu, the report also documented a pattern of grave international humanitarian law and rights violations – including looting, sexual violence, and killings – by retreating Congolese soldiers and Wazalendo fighters at the same time. “These abuses occurred in a climate of impunity, in the general context of a weakening chain of command,” it said. Al Jazeera sought a response to these claims from the Congolese government, but received no reply. In dismissing the report, the Rwandan president accused the panel of perpetuating a biased narrative against Kigali and of ignoring Congolese government complicity with the FDLR, which he says continues to spread anti-Tutsi views that led to the 1994 genocide. “All the reports, 75 percent of them, blame AFC/M23 and Rwanda,” Kagame said at the July 4 news conference. “You will find they never write anything comprehensive about FDLR or how Congolese institutions spread hate and genocide ideology. How can experts not see that?” Speaking to Al Jazeera, Rwandan analyst Thierry Gatete echoed Kagame’s criticisms, questioning the credibility of the UN panel and alleging that they rarely conduct field research. “They sit in New York or Paris and rely on testimonies from Congolese officials or FDLR sympathisers,” he said. The report notes that Rwanda denied the group of experts access to Kigali. However, Gatete says Rwanda initially cooperated with the panel but later gave up because the reports were consistently biased and, in his view, inconsequential. “Nobody takes what they write seriously,” he said. While Rwanda and Uganda view the UN reports as biased, others see them as essential tools for accountability. Stewart Muhindo, a researcher with Congolese civil society group LUCHA, said the panel provides critical evidence that challenges both state and non-state actors. “The panel tells hard truths,” he noted, pointing out that the report also criticises the DRC government for its continued collaboration with the FDLR, despite promises to end the alliance. “It’s not just about blaming Rwanda.” Muhindo also agrees with UN experts that the DRC’s reliance on Wazalendo fighters has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. These irregular forces, though not sanctioned like the FDLR, have been implicated in atrocities, including attacks on civilians and the recruitment of child soldiers, he said. “Despite ongoing peacemaking initiatives, efforts to stabilise the region continue to face significant challenges,” the UN experts said in the report. “Civilians bore the brunt of the conflict, enduring widespread displacement, insecurity, and grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.”"
Snoop Dogg becomes Swansea City co-owner in rivalry with Wrexham,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/18/snoop-dog-becomes-swansea-city-co-owner-in-rivalry-with-wrexham,,"Snoop Dogg has become co-owner of English Championship side Swansea City in an unlikely alliance between the world of rap and football, the Welsh club announced. The 53-year-old American star joins former Real Madrid stalwart and Croatia World Cup finalist Luka Modric in the club’s ownership structure. Snoop Dogg made a surprise appearance on the club’s social media channels last week, modelling their new home jersey for the 2025-26 season, and the club announced on Thursday that he has become an investor. Swansea’s Welsh rivals Wrexham have achieved a meteoric rise to the championship – the second-tier of English football – since Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the club in 2020.  Snoop Dogg’s Swansea involvement comes after American businessmen Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen took over the club last November. Swansea will hope that Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, can use his 100 million-plus social media followers to boost the club’s profile as they seek to return to the Premier League for the first time since they were relegated in 2018. Swansea’s owners have said they want to generate greater revenue, which would allow them to invest more in new players under the profit and sustainability rules in British football. The 53-year-old rapper said on the club’s website: “My love of football is well known, but it feels special to me that I make my move into club ownership with Swansea City. “The story of the club and the area really struck a chord with me. This is a proud, working-class city and club. An underdog that bites back, just like me. “I’m proud to be part of Swansea City.” Swansea announced in April that Modric, who this week joined AC Milan at the age of 39 after leaving Real Madrid, had acquired a stake in the club. “To borrow a phrase from Snoop’s back catalogue, this announcement is the next episode for Swansea City as we seek to create new opportunities to boost the club’s reach and profile,” Swansea’s owners said in a statement. “Snoop’s colossal global fanbase and audience will certainly help us do that, and he has made clear to us throughout this process just how excited he is at the prospect of joining the club.” “Snoop has openly shared his love of football and his desire to be involved in the game, and we expect his involvement to support us putting as competitive a team as possible out on the field.” Meanwhile, the Hollywood fairy tale that is Wrexham AFC is only just beginning, the club’s chief executive said on Friday as the Welsh side continued its unlikely quest to crack the English Premier League. Since Reynolds and McElhenney bought the Welsh club in 2020, Wrexham has become the first team to earn three successive promotions from England’s National League to the second-tier championship. Wrexham will play relegated former Premier League club Southampton in their championship opener on August 9, a prospect club chief executive Michael Williamson described as a “pinch yourself” moment. Williamson, speaking in Wellington during the club’s preseason tour to Australia and New Zealand, said success was more than simply making up the numbers. “The expectation is, and Rob McElhenney will say that he doesn’t know what this word is, but obviously we need to consolidate our position in the championship,” Williamson said. “If we are able to find ourselves halfway through the season, in December, in that 3-4-5-6-7 position, people should be worried about us. “Because I believe if we make the playoffs with the type of mentality that we have, anything can happen in 90 minutes. “I really would give ourselves a strong shot of giving it a run.” The Welsh minnows languished for years in the lower tiers of English football before being bought by Reynolds and McElhenney, and shooting to fame through the Welcome to Wrexham documentary. They return to the championship for the first time in more than 40 years. The fighting words were echoed by former Wrexham player-turned-club ambassador, Ben Tozer, who was also in New Zealand for the tour. “It’s a massive challenge, don’t get me wrong,” Tozer said. “But the momentum of our club, four years of pure success and heading in the right direction, winning a lot more games than losing. We could surprise some people.” Fellow club ambassador, former Wrexham and Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster, said the club had set itself apart by recruiting the right people. “If you look at it in the cold light of day, the stark reality is that money is going to start playing a massive role now,” Foster said. “When you’ve got players and clubs that have just been relegated from the Premier League, they’re on big wages and they’re big players and they’re worth big money because they are of a calibre of player. “But I’d like to think Wrexham can do it in a slightly different way where we identify the people, and the team is more important than the individuals.” Foster lauded a “no d********” policy at the club, which meant players and staff were working towards a common goal. Chief executive Williamson said the policy started in the dressing room and was led by manager Phil Parkinson. Over the past year, Wrexham’s staff numbers had grown by more than 60, to about 105. “I would say most of the 60 or so employees that have been hired, I’ve personally interviewed at some point,” Williamson said. “For me, it was important to bring in, especially on the senior leadership side, people who understood what Wrexham is and what we’re actually doing here. We’re not just another football club. “There are people who had incredible CVs, experience. You look at them and say, ‘Wow, you think that they would be incredible for Wrexham.’ “And then you go through the interview process and realise that they’re not really understanding what Wrexham is as a town, as a community, as a club. “That’s something that took a lot of effort. We’re trying to create a culture within the club.” Wrexham will return to Wales on Sunday, after playing Wellington Phoenix in New Zealand on Saturday evening. Parkinson confirmed the club was close to signing New Zealand international left back Liberato Cacace – a former Wellington Phoenix junior player – from Italian club Empoli. Cacace’s father, Antonio, owns an Italian restaurant in Wellington where Parkinson planned to drop in for a glass of wine before leaving the city on Sunday."
Ukraine war creates a generation at risk of being lost,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/7/15/ukraine-war-creates-a-generation-at-risk-of-being-lost,,"Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Varvara Tupkalenko’s two sons played with miniature cars like typical boys. Now, plastic guns dominate their living room in Kalynove, a village 15km (9 miles) from the Russian border in northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. Andrii, eight, and Maksym, six, once enjoyed playground games, but they now explore abandoned trenches and burned-out armoured vehicles on the village’s outskirts. “They’re kids afflicted by war,” Tupkalenko said. Europe’s largest land conflict since World War II is transforming devastated Ukrainian frontier communities like Kalynove, inflicting both visible and invisible wounds on their youngest residents. These hidden traumas extend beyond anxiety and fear to more profound effects, including poverty, depression and stunted emotional development, according to a February report by the NGO Save the Children. “This is how a lost generation becomes a reality,” the report said. “The longer the conflict continues, the more likely it is that these children will grow up without the opportunities and resources necessary to recover and normalise their lives.” When the Reuters news agency first visited Kalynove in late March, the boys were among six children remaining in the shrapnel-scarred village, whose landscape of open fields and gentle hills bears witness to Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Now they are the last children remaining after the others fled with their families, their mother said. Although a Ukrainian counteroffensive in late 2022 pushed Russian forces back from the village perimeter, both armies continue exchanging fire just 20km (12 miles) away, leaving the Tupkalenkos struggling to preserve any semblance of normal childhood. Military games dominate the boys’ play, including setting up pretend checkpoints to inspect fellow villagers. Their wooden fort features cloth netting – protection, they explain, from drones. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 30 children have been killed and 120 wounded by landmines or unexploded ordnance in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion."

"US House sends crypto ‘GENIUS Act’ to Trump, in win for industry advocates",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/17/us-house-sends-crypto-genius-act-to-trump-in-win-for-industry-advocates,,"The United States House of Representatives has passed three bills related to cryptocurrency, sending one directly to US President Donald Trump and the other two to the US Senate. The votes by the Republican-controlled chamber come amid a wider push by the Trump administration to make the US the “crypto capital of the world”, in what the president hasdubbed“crypto week”. Trump and his family’s emphasis on the largely unregulated crypto industry has also raised concerns it could be used to mask corruption and foreign influence. The bill that will go directly to Trump is called the GENIUS Act. It sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for a cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, which are tied to “stable” assets like the US dollar to reduce their volatility. House Financial Services Chair French Hill said during debate on Thursday that the bill will “ensure American competitiveness and strong guardrails for our consumers”. “Around the world, payment systems are undergoing a revolution,” he said. The legislationpassedin the Senate and by a 308-122 vote in the House. It garnered bipartisan support in both chambers. A second bill would create a new market structure for cryptocurrency. It passed by a slimmer margin of 294-134 and will need to go to the Senate, where lawmakers could craft a new version.    That legislation aims to provide clarity for how digital assets are regulated, mostly by defining what forms of cryptocurrency should be treated as commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and which are securities policed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Commodities are typically considered goods that can be traded or sold, while securities, like stocks and bonds, typically refer to partial ownership of an asset. A third bill, passed by a narrower 219-210 margin, would prohibit the US from offering what’s known as a “central bank digital currency”, essentially a government-issued form of digital cash. It will also head to the Senate. Cryptocurrencies, which are unmoored from any central government authority, have exploded in popularity since first emerging in 2009. But experts have said US operations have been curtailed by unclear laws governing the industry. Advocates have said the bills passed on Thursday could help to hearken in more mainstream adoption. Still, Democrats critical of the GENIUS bill accused Republicans of fast-tracking the passage, while failing to address Trump and future presidents’ interests in cryptocurrency.    For example, a provision in the bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. That prohibition does not extend to the president and his family. Trump’s family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin, USD1. Trump reported earning $57.35m from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released in June. A meme coin linked to him has also generated an estimated $320m in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors. “No one should be surprised that these same Republicans’ next order of business is to validate, legitimise, and endorse the Trump family’s corruption and efforts to sell the White House to the highest bidder,” Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services panel, said amid the flurry of votes on Thursday. Since taking office, Trump has alsoproposedcreating a cryptocurrency “national reserve” and has suspended Department of Justice investigations related to cryptocurrency. Some Democrats also criticised the GENIUS bill for creating what they called an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose longterm financial risks. They also say the legislation opens the door for major corporations to issue their own private cryptocurrencies."
How well did Trump and Epstein really know each other? A timeline,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline,,"A collection of letters gifted to the deceased, high-profilesex offender,Jeffrey Epstein, on his birthday in 2003 includes a birthday note bearing US President Donald Trump’s signature, the Wall Street Journal (WSG) reported on Thursday. Trump denies having written the letter and, on Thursday, told Attorney GeneralPam Bonditorequest a court releaseof the transcripts of all grand jury testimony in the Epstein case. The WSJ claims have reignited intrigue about Trump’s relationship with Epstein. We break down how closely, exactly, the two men associated with each other over the years. According to the WSJ report, Epstein was gifted a leather-bound collection of letters and notes for his 50th birthday in 2003. This had been compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate and partner, who was later charged as Jeffrey Epstein’saccomplicein his sexual abuse operation. She was found guilty in 2021 and is now serving a20-year prison sentencehanded down in 2022. The letter included typewritten text in the third person. It also featured a drawing of a woman’s breasts and was signed “Donald”. The drawing appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker, the WSJ reported. The letter ended with: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Al Jazeera could not independently verify the authenticity of the letter.    Following the revelations about the letter, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures. “I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his a** off, and that of his third rate newspaper. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DJT.” He also wrote: “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!” Soon after Trump’s statement, Bondi announced on X that the Justice Department planned to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts in court on Friday. Here’s what we know about how well the two men really knew each other. in 2002, Trump told the New York Magazine that he had been friends with Epstein since about the late 1980s. In the 1980s, Trump was a businessman and a real estate mogul. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump said. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump continued. Through the 1990s, the two men were spotted socialising at high-profile gatherings. In November 1992, Trump threw a party with NFL cheerleaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He had invited NBC to record the event. The tape from the party, published by NBC online in 2019, shows Trump laughing with Epstein, their conversation drowned by the really loud music. In 1997, Epstein and Trump were seen together at the Victoria Secret “Angels” party in New York. Trump also frequently flew on Epstein’s private jets – seven times in total between 1993 and 1997 – according to flight logs presented as evidence during Maxwell’s trial. This included four times in 1993, once in 1994, once in 1995 and once in 1997. The flights were between Palm Beach and New York, and they included a stop in Washington, DC. There are pictures of the two men at a party at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in 2000. These images also feature Maxwell and Trump’s now wife, then known as Melania Knauss. In January 2024, about950 pagesof court documents identifying associates of Epstein weremade public. Trump was mentioned in these documents, but was not accused of anything. Virginia Giuffre, one of the women who accused Epstein of sexual abuse, told the court that she was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited by Maxwell to become Epstein’s masseuse at the age of 16. Giuffre said that Epstein and Maxwell groomed her into performing sexual acts with adult men, including Prince Andrew. Johanna Sjoberg, another woman who accused Epstein of sexual abuse, recalled a 2001 flight from Florida on which she and Virginia Giuffre, then underage, were among the passengers. Due to a storm, the plane diverted to Atlantic City, where they visited one of Trump’s casinos. Sjoberg said of Giuffre: “I did not know anything about how old you had to be to gamble legally. I just knew she could not get in because of an ID issue, so she and I did not gamble.” Giuffredied by suicidein April this year. The WSJ published the text of a letter allegedly written by Trump for Epstein’s birthday. It appears to be in script form: “Voice Over: There must be more to life than having everything. Donald: Yes, there is, but I won’t tell you what it is. Jeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it is. Donald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey. Jeffrey: Yes, we do, come to think of it. Donald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that? Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you. Donald: A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” According to the report, Trump told the WSJ on Tuesday that he did not write the letter, and threatened to sue the publication. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he told the Journal. “The Wall Street Journal, and Rupert Murdoch, personally, were warned directly by President Donald J Trump that the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE and, if they print it, they will be sued,” Trump reiterated in a post on his Truth Social platform. Rupert Murdoch controls the WSJ’s publisher, News Corp. In 2004, Trump and Epstein had a falling out over a foreclosed oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach. The Washington Post reported that Trump had outbid Epstein on the property. Since that date, there was sparse public evidence of the two men interacting. In 2005, Florida police investigated claims Epstein had sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl after the girl’s parents made the complaint. Epstein was charged by Palm Beach police officials with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor. However, the State Attorney took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which indicted Epstein on a single count of soliciting prostitution. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges involving a single victim. He served 13 months in jail under a work-release programme that permitted him to leave during the day for work and return to jail at night.    During Trump’s first presidential term in 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking. In July 2019, Trump was asked by a reporter about Epstein, to which he responded: “Well, I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him. I mean, people in Palm Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach.” Trump added: “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don’t think I’ve spoken to him for 15 years.” Epsteindiedin a Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019. During an interview after Epstein’s death, Trump said about the case: “I want a full investigation, and that’s what I absolutely am demanding.” In 2024, while campaigning for the election, Trump said he would release information about the Epstein case. He also appointed Pam Bondi to be the Attorney General. During an interview with Fox News in February, Bondi was asked, “The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients, will that really happen?” She responded, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.” However, on July 7, the US Department of Justice released a memo stating that a government review hadfound no evidencethat Epstein had a specific “secret client list”. The memo also reaffirmed that Epstein had died by suicide, a claim that manyconspiracy theoristsamong Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base disbelieve. They believe Epstein was murdered because he had sensitive information about powerful figures, and that this was covered up. When Trump and Bondi were questioned by reporters about the July 7 memo, Trump said: “I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we’re having some of the greatest success and also tragedy, with what happened in Texas,” referring toflash floodsthat roiled the southern US state over the weekend before the memo was released, killing109 people. “It just seems like a desecration,” Trump added. Trump recently expressedangertowards his supporters over Epstein conspiracy theories. “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday."
How will the PKK’s disarmament play out in the region?,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/15/how-will-the-pkks-disarmament-play-out-in-the-region,,"On Friday, 30 fighters from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) threw their weapons into a bonfire at a meeting in Sulaimaniyah, a city in the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. After hiding out in Iraq’s Qandil Mountains for three decades, where they reportedly trained for combat and planned attacks against Turkiye, they were now renouncing their armed struggle. The symbolic gesture is the first phase of disarming the PKK as part of a rejuvenated peace process with Turkiye, which could end a 40-year conflict that has killed some 40,000 people. As the process unfolds, a question arises about how this may affect the broader region, including the autonomous Kurdish areas in Iraq and Syria.    In February, jailed PKK leader Abdulla Ocalan called on his fighters to fully disarm, saying the time for armed struggle was over and Kurds could now realise their rights through politics. Senior PKK leaders heeded the call in April and agreed to a new peace process with Turkiye. The success of the peace process largely hinges on reintegration and the political and cultural rights Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will confer on Kurds, according to Gonul Tol, an expert on Turkiye and the PKK with the Middle East Institute think tank. While Erdogan and his far-right coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, support the new process, the implementation remains shrouded in secrecy, say analysts. They believe the government is wary of disclosing details to avoid public backlash from some nationalist quarters, who may see any concessions as rewarding the PKK for armed rebellion. The process will likely entail a general amnesty for PKK fighters and giving Kurds the political and cultural rights they have long demanded, which would allow disarmed PKK fighters to return to Turkiye from northern Iraq, Sinan Ulgen, an expert on Turkiye and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, said. Only senior leaders would continue to live abroad, without fear of being targeted. However, he added, there has been no public discussion of how the government plans to reintegrate former PKK fighters into civilian life. “The lack of transparency raises the question over how much public support there is for this initiative,” Ulgen told Al Jazeera. According to Tol, Kurdish politicians are expecting Erdogan to make some political concessions to the Kurds through the recently established Turkish Parliamentary Committee. Failure to do so, she warns, could collapse the peace process. The exact number of PKK fighters is unknown, but rough estimates suggest there are between 2,000 to 5,000 in the Qandil Mountains. Since the 1990s, the PKK has reportedly plotted attacks against the Turkish state from these mountains with no real resistance from Iraqi authorities. This dynamic continued after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, which officially brought about an autonomous Kurdish region in the north. Turkiye has on many occasions bombarded PKK positions in the mountains, often relying on jets, artillery and helicopters. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which governs the Kurdish autonomous region, has never interfered in the fighting, noted Nazli Tarzi, an independent analyst on the Middle East and North Africa, with expertise on Iraq However, she said Iraq’s Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), may now try to exploit the peace process if it succeeds. They could exaggerate their role in the process to attract voters in the upcoming national elections in November, she added. “Things always heat up during an election cycle, and they could use the [disarmament] as a point-scoring exercise,” Tarzi told Al Jazeera.    The other scenario, said Tarzi, would see a resumption of conflict between Turkiye and the PKK in the Qandil Mountains. She added that the KRG has strong commercial and economic ties with Turkiye and will likely remain quiet and in the peripheries if the peace process collapses and conflict resumes. On top of that, she explained, the KRG cannot assist Turkiye with such a complicated military operation. “They don’t have the capacity for a scheme of that scale, and it would be quite costly. Also, I don’t think Turkiye would want to outsource. They would want to call the shots,” she said. The PKK has its own reasons to lay down arms and see through the peace process, analysts told Al Jazeera. Salim Cevik, an expert on Turkiye and a non-resident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, noted that the group is militarily weak after being driven out of Turkiye in 2016. During that period, the PKK in Turkiye was trying to carve out an autonomous region which would link up with its counterpart, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), in Syria. At the time, Kurds from Syria and Turkiye were joining the fight against ISIL (ISIS) with US support, while expanding their control over majority-Kurdish and Arab regions in northern Syria. But since March 10, the YPG has been negotiating its own deal with Syria’s new authorities – a close ally of Turkiye that came to power after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December. Analysts previously told Al Jazeera that any agreement between Syria’s new authorities and the YPG would lead to some limited form of Kurdish autonomy in Syria, but with greater oversight and control from the central government. “PKK expectations seem clear … that Turkiye will stop trying to undermine Kurdish autonomy in Syria [as part of the peace process],” said Cevik. However, Tol said Turkiye still worries that PKK fighters could mobilise in Syria if the peace process suddenly collapses, referencing the close ties between the two Kurdish factions. “The Turkish government must be thinking that they are going to have thousands of YPG fighters right on their border if this thing doesn’t work out,” she told Al Jazeera. Although analysts believe disarmament should go smoothly, some PKK fighters could refuse to disarm if they are unhappy with the process or believe that Ocalan, who has been in Turkiye’s custody since 1999, is out of touch, said Ulgen. “Turkiye is relying on Ocalan to steer the entire PKK conglomerate … whether they will all listen remains an open question,” Ulgen told Al Jazeera. Their cooperation will hinge on how soon Turkiye will confer fundamental rights on Kurds, he added. Burcu Ozcelik, a security expert on Turkiye and the PKK with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), believes a splinter is very unlikely. She explained that Ocalan has remained influential in the ideological evolution of the group and that he has retained the loyalty of PKK fighters since he was captured. In addition, she said, Turkiye appears to view the rejuvenated peace process, the disarmament of PKK fighters and their reintegration into civil life as imperative for national security. She referenced Turkiye’s historical and increasingly truculent relationship with regional powers such as Iran and Israel.    Israel, in particular, appears to view Turkiye’s regional influence as a threat to its power and agenda in the region. Turkiye may be concerned, said Burcu, that Israel may therefore attempt to instrumentalise Kurdish armed groups to thwart what they perceive to be Turkiye’s influence, regionally. “In the aftermath of Assad’s fall in Syria, Israeli government officials were very vocal of the Kurds being a natural ally to Israel and that Israel should support Kurdish autonomy,” she told Al Jazeera. This possibility is incentivising Turkish ministers to reach a deal with the PKK to thwart the possibility of foreign meddling. “I think Turkey’s assessment is that if it can’t conclude the conflict on its own terms, then there will be other actors looking to spoil the strategic dynamic for their own favour,” she added."
Trump diagnosed with ‘chronic venous insufficiency’ after leg swelling,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/trump-diagnosed-with-chronic-venous-insufficiency-after-leg-swelling,,"United States President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with “chronic venous insufficiency” after he was examined for leg swelling and bruising on his hands, according to the White House. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the malady a “benign and common condition” in which damaged veins prevent blood from flowing properly. Reading a letter from Trump’s physician, Leavitt added that the condition has higher rates “in individuals over the age of 70”. The 79-year-old Trump is theoldest personin US history to assume the presidency and madequestionsover former President Joe Biden’s age a defining issue in the 2024 election. Biden, who is three years Trump’s senior, later dropped out of the race amid pressure from his own party, handing the Democratic candidacy to former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump months later. Nevertheless, the president has continued to attack Biden’s age and mental fitness. On Thursday, Leavitt said there was “no evidence” of more serious issues like “deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease”. She said all Trump’s test results “were within normal limits” and he had “normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness”. The spokesperson also fielded questions over bruises on Trump’s hand, which had stoked online speculation over his health. Leavitt said the bruises were “consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen”. While not legally required, it has become common practice for US presidents to release annual physicals and details of their health. During his 2015 campaign, Trump’s personal doctor, Harold Bornstein, released a letter saying he could “state unequivocally” that Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency”. Bornstein later told CNN Trump had dictated the hyperbole-laced note."
Pakistan rains death toll rises to at least 180 after 65 die in one day,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/dozens-killed-in-pakistan-as-heavy-monsoon-season-persists,,"Heavy monsoon rains across Pakistan’s Punjab province have killed 65 people and injured nearly 300 in the past 24 hours, provincial officials said, bringing the nationwide death toll from the rains to at least 180 since late June. The downpours on Thursday caused flooding and building collapses, with most of the deaths caused by the roofs of weaker homes failing. Lahore, the eastern provincial capital, reported 15 deaths, Faisalabad nine, and the farming towns of Okara, Sahiwal and Pakpattan several more. Rescue teams used boats to evacuate families from villages along riversides further south in the morning, but the water had begun to recede by the afternoon. “Children were screaming for help, and women stood on rooftops, waving their shawls and begging to be rescued,” said Tariq Mehbood Bhatti, a 51-year-old farmer in Ladian village. Residents living in low-lying areas near the Nullah Lai River, which runs through Rawalpindi city, neighbouring the capital Islamabad, were ordered to evacuate after a sharp rise in the water level. “Rescue teams are on standby for more evacuations,” a spokeswoman for the disaster agency said. The Rawalpindi government declared a public holiday on Thursday to keep people at home. Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Punjab’s Chakwal district, said “heavy rains [are] causing extensive damage and also loss of life” across the Punjab region. Rains have “swept away small dams which have burst at banks,” he said, adding that the military is using helicopters to evacuate people who are now surrounded by water. “Pakistan has seen devastating floods over the last few years. This monsoon season is not different,” Hyder added. Experts have warned that the country can see extreme weather in the coming years, he said. Since late June, the monsoon rains have killed 103 people and injured 393 in Punjab alone, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). More than 120 homes were damaged and six livestock animals killed. A high flood alert was issued for the Jhelum River at the northern town of Mangla, where water inflows were expected to surge to high levels, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Authorities warned that adjoining streams could also overflow in the next 24 hours, putting nearby communities at risk. Monsoon rains are a routine part of South Asia’s climate and are essential for crop irrigation and replenishing water supplies. However, their adverse impact has worsened in recent years due to rapid urban expansion, poor drainage systems, and more frequent extreme weather events linked to climate change."
Indian state blames RCB cricket team for deadly IPL stampede,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/18/indian-state-blames-cricket-team-for-deadly-stampede,,"State authorities have blamed the management of India’s Royal Challengers Bengaluru cricket team for last month’s deadly stampede during celebrations for their first Indian Premier League (IPL) title. Karnataka state authorities singled out the RCB, its partners and the state cricket association for their mismanagement of the event in a report made public on Thursday. Eleven fans were crushed to death and more than 50 wounded ina stampede near the M Chinnaswamy Stadiumafter hundreds of thousands packed the streets in the southern city of Bengaluru on June 4, to cheer their hero Virat Kohli and other RCB team members. The report said organisers had not submitted a “formal request” or provided enough detail for permission to be granted for the celebrations. “Consequently, the permission was not granted,” it said. The team went ahead with its victory parade despite police rejecting RCB’s request, according to the report. The RCB did not offer any comment on the report. Four people, including a senior executive at RCB, representatives of event organisers DNA, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association, weredetained by policein the days following the stampede. Players were parading the trophy near the stadium a day aftertheir win over Punjab Kingsin the final in Ahmedabad when the stampede occurred. The dead were aged between 14 and 29. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it “absolutely heartrending”, and Kohli, who top-scored in the final, was“at a loss for words”after it unfolded. India coach Gautam Gambhir said he was never a fan of roadshows, and the authorities should not have allowed the mass celebrations if they were not prepared."
Ons Jabuer takes tennis break to ‘rediscover joy of living’,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/jabuers-tennis-prompted-by-desire-to-rediscover-joy-of-living,,"Three-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur is taking a break from competitive tennis, the 30-year-old said in a social media post. Tunisia’s Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam final, has struggled with her form in recent months, failing to get past the third round of a major this year. The two-time Wimbledon finalist’s campaign came to a disappointing end at the All England Club last month as she retired from her first-round clash against Viktoriya Tomova, unable to continue after a long medical timeout. The former world number two suffers from asthma andexperienced breathing difficultiesat this year’s Australian Open. Jabeur, often called the “minister of happiness” for her cheerful personality, said she was not feeling truly happy on the court. “For the past two years, I’ve been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges. But deep down, I haven’t truly felt happy on the court for some time now,” she said in a statement. “Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it’s time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.” Jabeur, married to former fencer Karim Kamoun, has also been open about her wish to start a family. “Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always,” she added."

"Across 100 kilometres, they walk where Srebrenica’s dead once ran",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2025/7/16/across-100-kilometres-they-walk-where-srebrenicas-dead-ran,,"Nezuk and Potocari, Bosnia and Herzegovina– Thirty years ago, thousands of Bosniak men and boys emerged emaciated from the forests surrounding the quiet Bosnian village of Nezuk. Their gaunt faces and skeletal frames told only part of the story – visible hints of a far deeper horror that would fully emerge only after the mass graves of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide were found. Today, Sejfudin Dizdarevic, 48, lives a life worlds apart from the desperate men who once fled through these woods. But he and thousands of others have just spent three days walking the same path. “Knowing this history, it makes you humble,” Dizdarevic said about his participation in the annual remembrance walk called the Peace March. “Knowing that you are going [on] the path [where] not only people were killed, but also [that those] who survived ... were hiding exactly in the spot [in] which you are marching now.” In July 1995, the town of Srebrenica and surrounding villages fell to Bosnian Serb forces, whose nationalist and territorial ambitions were emboldened by the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. Bosniak males, who were being hunted, fled the area, crossing the thickly forested slopes of eastern Bosnia for days and even weeks on end in a journey now referred to as “the death march”. During their trek, they evaded deceptive calls by Bosnian Serb forces, who tried to lure them to surrender with false promises of safety. Many of the Bosniak men and boys saw their counterparts slaughtered en masse and were forced to wade through the pungent odour of their corpses stiffening under the blazing July heat. Since 2005, Bosnians and people from around the world have been embarking on the three-day, 100-kilometre (62-mile) walk from Nezuk to the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial in Potocari, where newly identified victims are still laid to rest each year. Dizdarevic, a Bosnian war refugee who fled to Germany in 1992, has been returning to take part in the march for the last four years and organising groups of nationals from other countries to join him. While Dizdarevic, who is Bosniak, was not personally affected by the Srebrenica genocide, some of his family members were killed during Bosnia’s three-year war from 1992 to 1995. “My intention is to show respect for those who were killed in the genocide,” he explained."
‘A true hell’: How three Srebrenica survivors defied death 30 years ago,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/12/a-true-hell-how-three-srebrenica-survivors-defied-death-30-years-ago,,"Before the war scattered his family, Nedzad Avdic loved geography. He had just entered his teens. Growing up in the village of Sebiocina in Srebrenica municipality, close to the border with Serbia, Avdic could explain the difference between clustered and dispersed settlements. He learned how one could tell north from south by noticing which side of a tree the moss grew on, and discovered how to find constellations and navigate by the North Star. “I didn’t study it for survival,” Avdic, now 47, would later write in his memoir. “I studied it because I loved it.” But in the spring of 1995, three years into a conflict that still scars the Balkans, he would come to live in the geography of eastern Bosnia, trudging through forests alongside8,000 other Bosniak men and boys, trying to survive. Avdic was 17 by then and living in a United Nations-run refugee camp in the valley of Slapovici, just south of Srebrenica, a small town in eastern Bosnia nestled in a deep valley near the Drina River, which has historically served as a natural border with Serbia. At the time, Srebrenica had a population of just 6,000 and was locally known for its ancient silver deposits, from which it took its name – the Bosnian word for silver is srebro. The UN camp, built on previously uninhabited land, was home to more than 3,000 displaced Bosniaks, South Slavic Muslims native to Bosnia and Herzegovina, who lived in rows of Swedish-donated wooden cabins. There was no electricity, no plumbing and never enough food. Bosnia was a young country then, newly independent after thecollapse of Yugoslavia, having declared independence on March 1, 1992, after a public referendum. At the time, Bosnia’s population was ethnically diverse – roughly 44 percent Bosniak, 31 percent Serb and 17 percent Croat – making it one of the most multiethnic republics of the former Yugoslavia. By then, Bosnian Serbs had proclaimed what they would call Republika Srpska, a notional quasi-state that the community’s political leaders wanted to carve out from Bosnia, ostensibly to defend its interests. Only a month later, on April 6, Bosnian Serb forces, backed by Serbia, launched a war to seize territory and expel non-Serbs towards that goal. Towns close to the border were shelled, civilians forced out, and families like Avdic’s had to flee. His family – father Alija, mother Tima, and three younger sisters – would be uprooted several times throughout the war: first from their home in Sebiocina, then from makeshift shelters in Srebrenica town, before they reached the refugee camp in Slapovici. In 1993, after a Serb attack on a schoolyard that killed 56, many of them children, and wounded more than 70, Srebrenica and its surrounding villages were declared a UN “safe area,” by the UN Security Council along with five other towns and cities in Bosnia. The declaration demanded an “immediate cessation of armed attacks by Bosnian Serb paramilitary units against Srebrenica” and that Serbia and Montenegro, then called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, “immediately cease the supply of military arms” to the Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces. But the Serb bombardment of the town and its neighbouring villages never stopped. At the time, Avdic told Al Jazeera, “We believed the war would eventually end – that it had to.” “The United Nations was there, the Blue Helmets, and we told ourselves the darkness couldn’t last forever. Of course, we all feared for our lives – we knew that on any given day we could be killed,” he said. “But the scale of what would happen next was beyond anything we could have imagined.” At dawn on July 6, 1995, the hills around Srebrenica thundered with artillery fire. It was the start of Operation Krivaja ‘95, an offensive ordered by Radovan Karadzic, then president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, aimed at capturing the enclave. In the Slapovici refugee camp, Avdic woke to the sound of shelling. “It just wouldn’t stop,” Avdic said. “It was clear it had become too dangerous to stay.” As Karadzic’s troops approached, Avdic and his family left on foot – he says on July 8 or July 9 – fleeing into the hilly forests towards villages near Srebrenica. “Reaching those villages was our last refuge,” he said.  Inside the town of Srebrenica, Hajrudin Mesic, 21, heard the same explosions from his family’s apartment. He had already lost two of his four brothers to the war – Idriz, 36, on March 3 from a sniper, and Senahid, 23, from shelling in the 1993 schoolyard attack on Srebrenica. Now, in July 1995, it felt like the town itself was about to fall. “That morning [July 6], everything shook,” he said. The army of Republika Bosnia and Herzegovina in Srebrenica – part of the country’s main military force, formed in April 1992 to defend against Serb aggression and made up largely of local defenders – had been disarmed by the United Nations two years earlier in exchange for peacekeeping, and had few resources with which to fight back. Dutch peacekeepers were present, but by then, their positions had already been pushed back several times by the 25,000-soldier strong Army of Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb military force, leaving the town’s outskirts exposed. On July 10, Serb forces started entering the town. Mesic was in the bathroom when his mother began pounding on the door. “‘Hajrudin, son, get out, the bullets and shrapnel are falling in our living room,’ I remember my mother screaming. They [the Bosnian Serb Army] were already in the town.” He grabbed a makeshift bag and slipped out with his elderly parents, mother Zaha and father Selim, and his two remaining brothers, Hasan and Safet, darting through side streets, using buildings for cover.  Across town, 16-year-old Emir Bektic and his family realised it was time to run on the morning of July 11. That day, Bektic’s father, Redzep, returned to their home in Srebrenica covered in blood. A child had died in his arms after a shell hit a nearby village which was under bombardment and where Redzep had volunteered to help carry the dead and wounded. “Srebrenica is no more,” he said. “We have to leave.” After years of surviving shelling, starvation and isolation, the enclave had collapsed. At about 4pm on July 11, General Ratko Mladic, leader of the Bosnian Serb forces, entered the UN-declared safe area. They started separating Bosniak women, young children and the elderly from men and boys, promising that the first group would be allowed UN shelter. Word spread among the 60,000 people in the enclave at the time – Srebrenica municipality’s pre-war population of 35,000, and the rest people who had been pushed out of neighbouring areas by the Bosnian Serb forces. Bosniaks fled in two directions: women and children moved towards the UN base in the village of Potocari, while between 12,000 and 15,000 unarmed men and boys set off into the hills, bound for Tuzla, the closest city beyond Bosnian Serb reach, nearly 100 kilometres to the north. It was a “free zone” that would guarantee their safety. Bektic and his father joined the forest-bound column. His mother and sister went to the UN base. “One question hung in the air,” he said. “Will we ever see each other again?” Meanwhile, Mesic and his family also chose to split – his elderly parents went to the UN base in Potocari, while he and his two brothers went to the woods. It was the same with Avdic, his father and uncle. Avdic’s mother and his sisters headed to the UN base in Potocari, while they marched towards Tuzla. On July 11, at about 6 -7pm local time, after two days of travelling on foot from the refugee camp in Slapovici, they reached the villages of Jaglici and Susnjari, approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) away, where they joined thousands of other men and boys. But the villages were under bombardment. The horses and cattle that people were using to ferry the dead and wounded panicked, running helter-skelter. “In that chaos, I lost my father,” Avdic said.  He suddenly found himself engulfed in a crowd of strangers. “I didn’t recognise a single face around me,” he said. In a panic, he began shouting for his father, pushing through the mass of people, calling his name over and over. “But I never saw him again,” he recalled. “Surrounded by thousands of people, I still felt utterly alone.” He joined them on the long walk through the dark forests of eastern Bosnia, hoping to reach Tuzla. The route to Tuzla, which remained under Bosnian government control throughout the war, was thick with oak, beech and pine, but also scattered with a dry, brittle fern native to Bosnia’s forests in summer. Temperatures were punishing, climbing as high as 34 to 36 degrees Celsius (93–97 degrees Fahrenheit) in the July heat. Every step through the dry undergrowth risked exposure. The crack of a branch or the rustle of dried ferns could give away their position to nearby Serb forces. “We walked in silence,” recalled Bektic. “Not out of discipline, because of fear. No one wanted to attract death.” “I was exhausted, hungry, and thirsty. We’d only managed to grab whatever food we could find in the house before marching through the woods. There was no time to prepare. That journey … all of it … was almost unbearable for me at 16.” On the night of July 12, at Kamenicko Brdo, 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Tuzla, the group that Bektic and his father were part of reached a stream. Overwhelmed by thirst, Bektic bent down to drink, but the water was thick with mud. “It wasn’t really water. It was more like muddy sludge. I felt sand in my mouth,” he said. Still, that single mouthful was all he had. Moments later, chaos erupted. Serb soldiers cut through the column, pulling out 15 to 20 people who had crossed the stream. They were ordered to climb a small hill and sit. Then came the words that changed everything: “You are prisoners.” “At that moment, they [the Bosnian Serb soldiers] were only debating one thing – how to kill us,” he said. “Some of them said, ‘Let’s kill them right here,’ while others suggested, ‘No, let’s take them down to the stream and slaughter them there.’” Exhausted and terrified, Bektic laid his head in his father’s lap. “No matter what happens, we’ll stay together. Just stay with me. Don’t fall asleep,” his father said. But Bektic did fall asleep and woke up only the next afternoon to find that he was leaning against a beech tree, alone. “My first instinct was to search for my father,” Bektic said. He called out. Waited. Searched. “Maybe he had gone to get water. Maybe he would come back.” He didn’t, leaving Bektic with a lifetime of questions: What had happened to his father? Had he been marched to his death by the soldiers? Had his father propped him against the tree in the dark to hide him from the Bosnian Serb Army? How had he slept through it all? “The last thing I remember from that night is his embrace.” After days on his own in the forest, Bektic found another group of Bosniaks, among them his uncle and his two cousins. But Serb soldiers soon surrounded them again, demanding surrender. Some tried to escape and were shot. As they were marching down the road, Bektic passed “hundreds of murdered people” in the heat, and he had to be careful not to “step on a body”. They were taken to a hill and ordered to sit in rows. A Serb commander announced that some boys would be released, and that any boy who wanted to go should stand up. Several boys about Bektic’s age stood up. “At that moment, none of us really understood what was happening”, Bektic said. “My uncle insisted that I get up and go, and we quietly argued,” he said. “I just wanted to stay with my uncle. I had started to feel safe again, and no matter what happened, I wanted to remain by his side. “My mother and sister had gone to Potocari, and I had no news of them. My father was somewhere in the forest – killed or taken, I didn’t know. I was completely alone, and just being with my uncle and among other people I knew made me feel a little more safe.” But eventually, he caved to his uncle’s pleas. “Go,” the commander said. As he stood up, he saw buses lined up in the valley below and ran towards them. He caught the last one just as its doors were closing. The bus was packed with women and children coming from the UN base in Potocari, going towards Tuzla. “Don’t ask anything,” one woman told him as they covered him with a blanket.  Further west in the forest, on July 13, near the village of Kamenice in Bratunac municipality – a former Bosniak village that had been burned and destroyed by Serb forces in 1993 – Avdic’s group was also cut off by soldiers. “They [the Bosnian Serb military] threatened us over megaphones, saying they’d bomb us if we didn’t surrender,” he said. “Then they promised to treat us under the Geneva Conventions.” “At first, they acted civilly. Then it started. The beatings. The insults. The humiliation.” Avdic was somewhere near the front. The soldiers told them to leave their belongings, that everything would be returned. He left his bag, with family photos inside, next to a tank. Standing there on the road, he still remembers that tank in front of him, and the vehicles nearby. On one of them, written in Cyrillic, were the words: The Queen of Death. Other vehicles began to arrive – civilian Volkswagen Golfs, packed with soldiers sitting on the hoods, roofs, and inside. More soldiers followed. Then came blue and white police cars, still the pre-war Yugoslav models. The police remained behind as Bosnian Serb soldiers ordered men and boys to start jogging towards a meadow about a kilometre from Kamenice. As they crossed the asphalt road, buses filled with refugees from Potocari pulled up and were forced to stop. The captured men were now blocking the road. “Among them, I recognise a girl I went to school with,” said Avdic. “And it’s obvious that some of the refugees in the buses recognise some of the people in our column, too. Women are crying as they probably recognised their family members among us – sons, brothers, fathers.” Eventually, the men and boys were ordered to continue running towards Kamenice, while the buses moved in the opposite direction towards Tuzla. They reached a meadow in the destroyed Bosniak village of Sandici. “The grass was already trampled, as if someone had played football there,” Avdic recalled. “Others had been there before us. And they had already been taken away.” Only later, while testifying before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, would Avdic learn what had happened on that same meadow just hours earlier: Ramo Salkic, a captured Bosniak refugee, had been filmed calling out to his teenage son Nermin to join him where the Serb soldiers stood. That footage, used as key evidence in the prosecution of the Srebrenica genocide, showed the chilling moment of surrender. Both father and son were later executed. That night, a Serb soldier told Avdic and others, “You’ll be returned to your families. Everything will be fine.” But the voice dripped with sarcasm, Avdic recalled. “They placed us all in rows and laid the wounded ahead of us.” Then came the order: lie down, hands behind heads – and applaud. “All of us, together, as hard as we could,” Avdic said. “We spent two to three hours doing that.” By the time the clapping stopped, the wounded were gone. “They had been taken into nearby houses and killed,” he said. “Gunfire echoed all around us.” Then came the shouting: “Long live the king! Long live Serbia!” The soldiers forced them to chant with them in unison, like a choir. Packed into trucks, Avdic and others were then driven through Bratunac town near Srebrenica and beyond. “Serbs cursed us from the sidewalks, threw stones,” he said. The July heat, he recalls, was “unbearable” inside the truck. “I remember peering through a hole in the tarpaulin [on the side of the truck]. In fact, that hole is what helped me breathe, so I wouldn’t suffocate. People around me were losing consciousness. They couldn’t breathe,” he said. “A true hell.” With no water and unable to bear the thirst, people started drinking their own urine, he said. “They were screaming, shouting, asking for water, saying: ‘Open the tailgates, or kill us already. We can’t take it any longer.’” Avdic tried to keep track of time, but after hours without food or water, he could no longer focus. Bosniak men on the truck who had earlier seen a UN vehicle pass by – and had hoped it was coming to rescue them and take them to Tuzla – began to lose hope. Rumours spread that they weren’t heading to Tuzla after all, but to Bijeljina, a city northeast of Tuzla near the border with Serbia, where Serbian nationalist paramilitary groups were maintaining a concentration camp.  They drove like that for about 50km, until they arrived at a school in Petkovici, about 70km from Srebrenica. By that time, it was already the morning of the next day, July 14. As the men were offloaded from the trucks and forced into the school, soldiers began beating those in the front with rifles and pipes. “It was chaos,” Avdic said. “They couldn’t strike everyone fast enough.” Inside the school, more Serb soldiers were waiting. One shouted, “Whose land is this?” Another answered, “This is Serb land – always has been, always will be.” The men were forced to repeat the phrase in unison. The ground-floor classrooms were already packed. Screams echoed from behind closed doors. Avdic and the others were taken upstairs to the second-last classroom on the first floor. Inside, he recognised his uncle. He learned that they had been together earlier in the meadow, but Avdic had not noticed him then. At one point, people started whispering about escape. “We should try jumping out the windows … or making a run for the doors,” someone said. “Maybe someone would survive that way, otherwise, we are all going to be killed.” Hearing the commotion, Serb soldiers stepped in and tried to calm the crowd. “The Red Cross is coming, prepare to be exchanged.” “And we all believed it. In a situation like that, you’d believe anything for a chance to survive,” Avdic said. His shirt was still soaked with urine from the journey, so he turned to the person next to him and asked if they had a spare T-shirt. A man sitting next to him pulled out one and handed it over. “The Red Cross was coming, and I felt embarrassed to be seen like that, all soaked. I was shy,” he said. The soldiers started taking men out of the classroom, five or six at a time. When it was his turn to go outside, Avdic asked his uncle to come with him. “But he refused. He stayed behind.” Once out in the hallway, soldiers ordered him and others to undress, tied their hands and marched them downstairs. He followed with others, leaving the clean shirt behind. There was blood in the hallway, bodies in front of the school, and more at the main entrance. He expected to be shot right there. But the soldiers loaded them back onto a truck. Once the truck was full, the soldiers fired a few bullets through the tarp to scare those inside. Screams filled the air as some people were hit and wounded. Bodies crushed against each other, but Avdic, who was not hit, managed to stay on his knees. Amid cries around him, Avdic recognised a voice behind him: “It was my geography teacher.” The truck started moving. When it finally stopped, it was about midnight. The men and boys were again ordered to get out. Soldiers began pulling people out again. By now, Avdic was sure that they were to be executed. “It all happened so fast,” Avdic said. “I tried to hide behind others, pressing myself into the crowd – but so was everyone else, each person trying to shield themselves behind someone else.” But Avdic had also accepted that he was going to die. “The only thing I wanted at that moment was to drink some water. I felt devastated that I’d die thirsty.” As he looked ahead, he saw what felt like an endless crowd — thousands of men. Then, the gunfire began, sudden and fierce. He couldn’t recall the exact moment he was hit. There was chaos, shouting, bodies dropping all around him. Then – blackness. When he regained consciousness, pain surged through his body. His right arm and side were burning; his whole body trembled. The stench of gunpowder clung to the air. Bullets had been fired at point-blank range – they had torn through the group without mercy. Bodies lay all around him. In the haze, he heard voices, soldiers nearby. One said, “Check if anyone’s still alive.” Another replied coldly, “They’re all dead.” Then came silence, followed by the sound of vehicles pulling away. Somewhere nearby, he noticed a man still moving. He called out softly, “Are you all right?” The man responded, “I am. Come. Untie me.” “I can’t … I can’t …” Avdic whispered. His voice faded in and out. Somehow, after what seemed like eternity, he managed to gather his strength and crawl over to the man, who had survived, almost unharmed, because he had been crushed under the weight of the bodies falling on him, and so, was saved from the bullets. With nothing else to use, Avdic began chewing through the ropes that bound the man, slowly and painfully. Thread by thread. The soldiers were gone, so the man stood up and began to walk. Avdic, still tied and injured, crawled beside him, over the bodies of executed men and boys, some still warm. They stumbled into a concrete drainage canal hidden in the brush, where the man untied Avdic’s wrists and began to carry him. When the man grew too tired, Avdic would drag himself forward on his stomach, inch by inch. They survived on wild apples plucked from trees. Weakened and bleeding, Avdic would beg the man, “Please, leave me behind. Save yourself.” But the man refused, every time. For days, they crept through dense forests, dodging Serb patrols, slipping past scorched Bosniak homes, and sleeping in the ruins of villages burned years earlier. Each time Avdic could go no farther, the man pointed to the next hill and whispered, “Just that one more … then we’ll stop.” Eventually, they crossed into Bosnian-held territory in Zvornik near Tuzla, barely alive. “Someone poured water on me,” Avdic later recalled. “And I cried. That’s when I knew. I had survived.” After surviving the shelling of his apartment in Srebrenica, Mesic joined the column fleeing through the forest with his two brothers, Hasan, 36, and Safet, 34, on July 11, while their parents had already taken refuge at the UN base in Srebrenica. After a day or two of moving, the column stalled – likely near Kamenica, a village in the Zvornik municipality near the border with Serbia – and was attacked by soldiers. Kamenica was one of the deadliest points along the escape route from Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serbs killed hundreds of men through a series of ambushes as they tried to flee through the forest. A fierce barrage of gunfire rained down on them. Mesic’s brother Hasan was shot in both arms. Amid the chaos, Mesic and his brothers tried to keep moving, but he lost sight of both Safet and Hasan. “I couldn’t see them any more,” he said. He pressed on with a small group of survivors, carrying the wounded through the woods. At one point, rain began to fall, and the survivors welcomed it. “It masked our steps,” he recalled. “Soaking wet, exhausted, we lay down and slept side by side, in the mud, under the rain.” Along the route, he reunited with a close friend, who shared his brother’s name, Hasan. “Only then did I feel a little safer again,” Mesic recalled. “I wasn’t alone any more.” But Mesic, Hasan and their group would have to face more gunfire. In the forests above Kamenica, the narrow trails had turned into visible roads, beaten down by thousands of desperate feet. Locals called it the trla, a tragic corridor etched into the landscape by death marches. Serb forces were already there, lying in wait. “They let us pass, and then opened fire,” Mesic said. “Many were killed.” He hit the ground along with Hasan. “I remember the sound of them changing rifle magazines,” he said. Hasan was shot. “Please don’t leave me,” he begged. “I didn’t, I couldn’t,” Mesic said. Once again, Mesic survived, with Hasan. By the time the two reached Brezik village, 50 kilometres (about 30 miles) from Tuzla, Mesic’s shoes had long fallen apart. He was walking in thin socks that had torn, and his feet were blistered. In one hand, he clutched several small, bruised wild pears which he had picked up in the forest – “the kind even livestock wouldn’t eat,” he said. “But we were starving. I couldn’t let them go.” They were close to what they believed was free territory when bullets hit the dirt around them again. “We have made it so far,” Mesic told his friend. “But I don’t know if we’ll make it this time.” Serb soldiers were positioned on nearby houses, so the two crawled through high, uncut grass to avoid being noticed until they fell into an abandoned Serb army trench. Inside, they found two wounded Bosniak men and a boy, who had been shot by the soldiers. The men died in front of them. The boy, 16-year-old Musa, was bleeding heavily from his leg. “He looked at me and said, ‘Do you have a shoelace? Anything I can tie my leg with?’” Mesic recalled. “You think I had shoelaces? I didn’t even have shoes.” In pain and panic, Musa began to cry out: “Serbs! I’m wounded! Come help me!” From somewhere beyond the trench, a voice called back: “Drop your weapon first!” Musa answered, “I don’t have a weapon! I’m a kid!” “He still believed someone might help,” Mesic said. But no help came. Musa was shot and killed where he lay. Realising they may be next, Mesic and Hasan ran for their lives under fire, slowing down only once the soldiers were out of range. “I still had the pears in one hand.” It was night, and they decided to wait for dawn before moving again. But suddenly, Mesic heard someone calling out to them. About 30 metres away, there was a soldier waving, motioning for them to come over. Mesic said to Hasan, “He’s calling us. Maybe he’s one of ours?” Hasan replied, “Are you kidding? That’s a Chetnik [a Serb nationalist fighter or paramilitary].” “If it was a Chetnik, he wouldn’t be smiling like that – he’d shoot us from here,” Mesic said. Hasan still didn’t want to go. Mesic was torn. He said again, “He’s smiling, that’s something only a friend would do.” Then, next to the soldier calling out to them,  Hasan recognised his friend Sakib. “It’s our army! It’s Bosniaks!” he told Mesic. The terrain of Brezik is rugged and broken up, and the two had crossed into Bosniak-controlled territory without realising it. They ran towards the Bosnian soldiers, who gave them bread. They had survived. Days later in Tuzla, Mesic was reunited with his parents, who had given him up for dead. Meanwhile, the bus Bektic had boarded in Potocari took him to Tisca, from where he walked as part of a civilian column to Kladanj, near Tuzla. “Even though I was part of a long column, I still felt completely alone,” he said. “But I survived. And that means I have to speak.” In 2004, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled that the Srebrenica killings were genocide. Serb leadersRadovan KaradzicandRatko Mladicwere both convicted of genocide – Karadzic in 2016, Mladic in 2017. In 2007, the International Court of Justice recognised Srebrenica as an act of genocide and found that Serbia failed in its obligation to prevent it. In just a few days in July 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered. Their remains were scattered across mass graves, many of them later disturbed in efforts to hide the crime. At least 25,000 women and children were expelled from the town. According to the State Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina, approximately 25,000 women were raped during the war. The actual number is believed to be significantly higher, as many survivors likely have never come forward because of the stigma associated with rape. In 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the first countries to legally recognise survivors of wartime sexual violence, but children born of wartime rape weren’t recogniseduntil 2022. To this day, more than 1,000 families are still waiting to find and bury their loved ones killed in the Srebrenica genocide. Those found are being buried in Potocari. In the early 2000s, Avdic testified at The Hague in the trials of those accused of committing genocide in Srebrenica. He later co-wrote a book with his sister, The Hague Witness, now translated into English and being translated into Arabic. He lost his father, three uncles – including the one who was with him in the school in Petkovici, three cousins, and many others in the genocide. From his immediate family, his mother Tima and his three sisters had survived. He never got back the family photographs he had left in his bag. Today, he lives in Srebrenica. Mesic lost four brothers, including Hasan and Safet –  the brothers he was fleeing Srebrenica with – and 24 relatives on his mother’s side. Hasan, who was shot in both his arms, was eventually killed by stepping on a mine placed by Bosnian Serb forces. His remains were found and laid to rest at the Potocari cemetery, while Safet is still missing to this day. Mesic lives in Sarajevo, where he teaches history and geography. Each year, he takes his students to Srebrenica and the memorial in Potocari. Bektic lost about 10 of his family members and relatives, among them his father Redzep, who was found in a mass grave in Kamenica. His uncle and two cousins, who were with him, were also executed. Today, Bektic lives in Sarajevo and is the author of A Dawn Alone, a personal account of his survival during the Srebrenica genocide, translated into English and Turkish."
Low turnout in Togo municipal polls after deadly protests,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/low-turnout-in-togo-municipal-polls-after-deadly-protests,,"Togo has voted inmunicipal electionsamid reports of voter apathy, after the country was rocked by deadly protests last month. Polling stations in Togo’s capital Lome were largely deserted on Thursday. The low turnout came after June’s protests againstconstitutional reformsthat could keep leader Faure Gnassingbe in power indefinitely. Rights groups blamed the police for the deaths of seven marchers in the protests, whose bodies had been fished out from the capital’s rivers by activists. “People are … afraid of being attacked by protesters for legitimising these elections, or afraid of being dispersed by security forces,” Edem Adjaklo, a voter in the Gakli neighbourhood, told The Associated Press news agency. “They feel it’s pointless to vote because the results are always the same – predetermined.” The sense of unease in Lome was reportedly heightened by a heavy police and military presence at major intersections. Despite a call for demonstrations against Gnassingbe, the streets of the seaside capital were quiet on Thursday. Gnassingbe has ruled the country since 2005, after the death of his father and predecessor as president, Gnassingbe Eyadema. The constitutional reforms, approved by a parliament dominated by Gnassingbe’s Union pour le Republic (UNIR) party, swapped the presidential system in the country for a parliamentary one. Under the reforms, Gnassingbe was sworn in two months ago as president of the Council of Ministers – effectively as prime minister – a role with no official term limits, which would allow him to be re-elected indefinitely. Critics called it a “constitutional coup”. Diaspora-based social media influencers and civil society groups had called for a boycott of the elections, the first national vote organised since the constitutional reform. This year’s bout of protests was triggered after popular rapper and TikToker Tchala Essowe Narcisse, popularly known as Aamron, was arrested for publishing a video where he called for protests to mark the president’s June 6 birthday.    Anger had also been simmering over the state of the economy, widespread unemployment and the repression of government critics. Public demonstrations have been banned in the country since protests between 2017 and 2018, which saw thousands of protesters taking to the streets in demonstrations tagged “Faure Must Go” and “Togo stands up”. Although officially a democracy, Togo operates in practice as a militarised state, with the army heavily involved in politics."
FIFA to launch 2026 World Cup ticketing process September 10,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/fifa-to-launch-2026-world-cup-ticketing-process-in-september,,"FIFA has announced that the process to purchase tickets for the 2026 World Cup in Mexico, the United States, and Canada will launch on September 10, urging fans looking to attend games to formally register their interest on its website. The announcement on Tuesday came a day after the FIFAClub World Cupconcluded in the US, a tournament that the international governing body for football hailed as a “rousing success”. “We’re looking forward to welcoming the world back to North America, as Canada, Mexico and the United States host what will be the biggest and greatest sporting event ever,” FIFA PresidentGianni Infantinosaid in a statement. “We encourage fans everywhere to get ready to secure their place – these will be the most coveted seats in world sport.” FIFA did not provide details for how the tickets will be released, but it said on September 10, pre-registered fans will be able to “apply for their first chance to buy tickets”. “There will be several distinct ticket sales phases from the start of sales on 10 September 2025, through to the final match on Sunday, 19 July 2026,” FIFA said. “Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products, and full details on each phase will be released in the coming months.” The World Cup will kick off in Mexico City on June 11 next year and conclude in New Jersey on July 19.    With the tournament expanded to 48 teams, it will see 104 games, with Canada and Mexico hosting 13 matches each. The rest of the games will take place in the US, including all the fixtures from the quarterfinal onwards. The US had a de facto test run for the big tournament with the Club World Cup that kicked off last month, withmixed results. Whilethe finalat MetLife Stadium, which saw Premier League giants Chelsea beat European champions Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, attracted a sold-out crowd of over 81,000 people, some games saw an abysmally low turnout. The searing hot weather also proved to be a challenge for players and fans, especially during midday games. However, many matches drew large crowds and a festive atmosphere, as well as some notablefootballing upsets. US PresidentDonald Trumpappeared to take a strong interest in the tournament. He hosted Italian club Juventus at the White House when the team was in Washington, DC, for a group stage game last month.    He attended the final in New Jersey and joined Chelsea players on stage for the trophy presentation. However, Trump’s restrictive immigration policies have sparked concerns about the ability of international fans to visit the US next year. In June, the US president imposed travel bans and restrictions on citizens of 19 countries, including Iran, whose national team has already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. While football is known as the world’s game, the sport has been behind American football, baseball and basketball in popularity in the US. Still, football has been steadily gaining interest in the country over the past decade, a trend accelerated by Argentinian great Lionel Messi’s moveto Inter Miamiin 2023. Qatar hosted thelast World Cupin 2022, with Argentina lifting the trophy for the third time in their history, cementing the status of Messi as one of the greatest players of all time."
Jude Bellingham shoulder surgery sidelines Real Madrid star until October,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/16/jude-bellingham-shoulder-surgery-sidelines-real-madrid-star-until-october,,"Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham is expected to miss up to 12 weeks recovering from a shoulder operation, after the Spanish giants said he had successfully undergone surgery. “Our player Jude Bellingham has undergone successful surgery for a recurrent left shoulder dislocation,” said Real Madrid in a statement on Wednesday. “Bellingham will now begin a period of rehabilitation prior to his return to recovery work.” While Madrid did not specify the expected length of his recovery time, Spanish media have reported it will take about 12 weeks for him to return to action, putting the star player out of action until the third week of October. Bellingham has been struggling with shoulder discomfort after dislocating it in a La Liga match in November 2023, and playing with a brace under his shirt since then. The England midfielder held off on the operation until after Madrid’s participation in the Club World Cup earlier this year, with Xabi Alonso’s side reaching the semifinals. The 2025-26 La Liga season begins for Real Madrid on August 19 with a home match against Osasuna. Bellingham is set to miss the La Liga Madrid derby against rivals Atletico in late September, as well as the club’s first two UEFA Champions League matches. The 22-year-old midfielder should be back in action by the time Madrid host Barcelona in the first Clasico of the season in late October. “I’ve got the point where … I’m fed up with the brace, and having to tug on it and having [other] players tug on it, and it rearranging all the time,” said Bellingham during the Club World Cup. The midfielder will also miss World Cup qualifiers with England against Andorra and Serbia on September 6 and 9, respectively."
"USAID food for nearly 30,000 hungry kids to be destroyed: Official",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/usaid-food-for-nearly-30000-hungry-kids-to-be-destroyed-official,,"Food intended to feed 27,000 starving children in Afghanistan and Pakistan will soon be incinerated in the wake of President Donald Trump’s closure of the United States’ aid agency. A senior US official on Wednesday said nearly 500 tonnes of high-energy biscuits, to be used as emergency food for malnourished young children, expired this month while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai. Under questioning by lawmakers, Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary of state in charge of management, tied the decision to the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which closed its doors on July 1. “I think that this was just a casualty of the shutdown of USAID,” Rigas said, adding that he was “distressed” that the food went to waste. Aid officials managed to save 622 tonnes of the energy-dense biscuits in June – sending them to Syria, Bangladesh and Myanmar – but 496 tonnes, worth $793,000 before they expired this month, will be destroyed, according to two internal USAID memos reviewed by Reuters, dated May 5 and May 19, and four sources familiar with the matter. The wasted biscuits will be sent to landfills or incinerated in the United Arab Emirates, two sources said. That will cost the US government an additional $100,000, according to the May 5 memo verified by three sources familiar with the matter. Trump has said the US pays disproportionately for foreign aid, and he wants other countries to shoulder more of the burden. His administration announced plans to shut down USAID in January, leaving more than 60,000 tonnes of food aid stuck in stores around the world, Reuters reported in May. The food aid stuck in Dubai was fortified wheat biscuits, which are calorie-rich and typically deployed in crisis conditions where people lack cooking facilities, “providing immediate nutrition for a child or adult”, according to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said lawmakers had specifically raised the issue of the food with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March. In May, he promised lawmakers that no food aid would be wasted. “A government that is put on notice – here are resources that will save 27,000 starving kids, can you please distribute them or give them to someone who can? “Who decides, no, we would rather keep the warehouse locked, let the food expire, and then burn it?” Rigas said that the US remained the world’s largest donor, and he promised to learn further details about the biscuits. “I do want to find out what happened here and get to the ground truth,” he said. The US is the world’s largest humanitarian aid donor, amounting to at least 38 percent of all contributions recorded by the UN. It disbursed $61bn in foreign assistance last year, just over half of it via USAID, according to government data. The Trump administration notified Congress in March that USAID would fire almost all of its staff in two rounds on July 1 and September 2, as it prepared to shut down. In a statement on July 1 marking the transfer of USAID to the State Department, Rubio said the US was abandoning what he called a charity-based model and would focus on empowering countries to grow sustainably. The WFP says 319 million people have limited access to food worldwide. Of those, 1.9 million people are gripped by catastrophic hunger and on the brink of famine, primarily in Gaza and Sudan."
Prosecutors recommend one day of prison for officer in Breonna Taylor death,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/prosecutors-recommend-one-day-of-prison-for-officer-in-breonna-taylor-death,,"The United States Department of Justice has requested that a former police officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor be given a prison term of a single day, plus three years of supervised release. That reduced sentencing recommendation marks a stark reversal for the prosecution, which began under former President Joe Biden and continued under current President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump appointee serving as assistant attorney general for civil rights, submitted acourt memorandumreflecting the government’s new stance. She argued that former police officerBrett Hankisonshould not be confined to prison for his actions in the early morning hours of March 13, 2020, when Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot to death in her apartment. Dhillon noted that Hankison had no criminal history before November 2024, when a federal jury found him guilty of using excessive force in violation of Taylor’s civil rights. These facts, Dhillon wrote, “demonstrate that there is no need for a prison sentence to protect the public from the defendant”. “For the reasons explained in this memorandum, the government requests a downward variance and a sentence of time served (one day’s imprisonment), followed by three years of supervised release.” But critics blasted the recommendation as disregard for the will of the jury — not to mention for Taylor’s life. “The fact that Donald Trump’s DOJ thinks Breonna Taylor’s life is worth just a one-day jail sentence is morally reprehensible and deeply insulting,”wroteUS Representative Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat whose district includes Louisville, Kentucky, where Taylor was shot to death. “This is a dark day for our entire city.”    Taylor’s killing at the hands of police officers in Louisville was a galvanising moment in the US, sparking debate over the use of police force in Black communities. It came just weeks before another unarmed Black person, George Floyd of Minnesota, was murdered by a police officer who knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Video of that incident — along with the news of Taylor’s killing and other deaths — provoked nationwide uproar, leading to one of the largest protest movements in US history. Taylor had been at home just after midnight local time, when a group of plain-clothed police officers arrived at the apartment where she was staying with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. The officers executed a so-called no-knock warrant, attempting to storm Taylor’s apartment unannounced, based on faulty evidence that her apartment was involved in a drug operation. Upon hearing the commotion, Walker said he believed he and Taylor were the targets of a home invasion, and he shot at the suspected intruders in self-defence. A pair of police officers returned fire in the doorway. Approximately22 bulletswere fired into the apartment, several of which hit Taylor, killing her. According to Justice Department prosecutors, Hankison then fired 10 more shots into the apartment through a window and sliding glass door, both of which were covered by curtains and blinds. They note that he could not see inside as he fired. None of Hankison’s bullets struck Taylor, a fact Dhillon noted in this week’s court memo. Hankison has testified that he believed his police colleagues were engaged in a gun fight with a semiautomatic rifle, and he fired through the side of the apartment to help in their defence.    Given the outcry surrounding deaths like Taylor’s, the administration of former President Biden had opened aggressive investigations and led prosecutions to hold police accountable for instances of excessive violence. In December 2024, for instance, the Department of Justiceannouncedit had reached a court-enforceable agreement with the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) to reform the force’s practices. That agreement stemmed from aMarch 2023 reportthat founda pattern of federal civil rights violationsunder the LMPD, including the use of excessive force and unlawful search warrants. “An LMPD leader told the department, quote, Breonna Taylor was a symptom of the problems that we had for years,” then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a prepared video statement in 2024. “The findings of our investigation, which I came to Louisville to announce last year, made that clear.” But since taking office in January, the Trump administrationhas rolled backthe federal government’s agreements with police departments found to have committed patterns of civil rights violations. One of the cancelled deals pertained to Louisville. Dhillon, at the time, called those reform agreements an example of “federal micromanagement”. In this week’s court filing, Dhillon wrote that she did not dispute that Hankison fired blindly into Taylor’s apartment on the night of her killing. She also said that the government “respects the jury’s guilty verdict” in Hankison’s case. But she nevertheless pointed out that Hankison had been acquitted of state-level charges, and his first federal trial ended in a mistrial in November 2023. Federal prosecutors retried the case the following year. Dhillon underscored that Hankison did not fire the fatal bullet. “Counsel is unaware of another prosecution in which a police officer has been charged with depriving the rights of another person under the Fourth Amendment for returning fire and not injuring anyone,” she wrote.    But the recommendation that Hankison’s sentencing be dropped to a single day has reignited the outrage around Taylor’s killing — and the mourning for a young life cut short. In a statement on Thursday, the civil rights lawyers who represented Taylor’s family, including Ben Crump, issueda joint statementdenouncing Dhillon’s sentencing recommendations as farcical. “This recommendation is an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury’s decision. Every American who believes in equal justice under the law should be outraged,” they wrote. “This sets a dangerous precedent. When a police officer is found guilty of violating someone’s constitutional rights, there must be real accountability and justice. Recommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity.” Hankison faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for his role in the fatal shooting."
Who better than Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize?,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/9/who-better-than-trump-for-the-nobel-peace-prize,,"In the latest instalment of the “can’t-make-this-sh*t-up” contest in global politics and diplomacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has nominated United States President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. In other words, the person currently presiding over thegenocide of Palestiniansin the Gaza Strip has proposed that the world’s top peacemaking prize be awarded to the primary enabler of that genocide – the man who in Marchannouncedthat he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job” in Gaza. That “everything” has entailed billions of dollars in lethal weaponry and other assistance.     From October 2023 to the present, nearly 60,000 Palestinians have officially been slaughtered in the diminutive territory, although the true death toll is no doubt far higher considering the surplus of bodies lost under the pervasive rubble.More than 700Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while seeking food at aid distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an organisation backed by both the US and Israel. Since resuming office in January, Trump has also managed plenty of do-it-yourself activity of a decidedly unpeaceful nature, such as wantonlybombing civilians in Yemenand illegallyattacking Iran. Indeed, it is a wonder that media outlets have managed to report on Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize nomination with a straight face. CNN, for example,notesthat “the award has become Trump’s ultimate fixation, one he says is well deserved for his efforts to end conflicts around the globe”. The president was informed of his nomination on Monday, when Netanyahu showed up for dinner at the White House as part of his thirdvisit to Washingtonthis year. Thanking Netanyahu for the honour, Trump remarked: “Wow … Coming from you, in particular, this is very meaningful.” And while “meaningful” is certainly one way to put it, the term does not quite convey the utter preposterousness of the whole arrangement. Then again, it’s not like the Nobel Peace Prize enjoys a very solid track record in terms of living up to thestipulationthat it be awarded to the person “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses”. In 2009, the prestigious accolade was bestowed on newly inaugurated US President Barack Obama, who would go on to stimulate international “fraternity” bybombingAfghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Syria. Obama also operated secret “kill lists”, whereby he authorised military assassinations abroad in accordance with his own personal whims. Other esteemed recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize have included Colombia’s right-wing former PresidentJuan Manuel Santos, who, as the Israeli newspaper Haaretzreportedin 2013, was “proud” to have his country called “the Israel of Latin America”. As defence minister during the blood-drenched reign of his predecessor Alvaro Uribe, Santos was embroiled in the so-called “false positives” scandal that saw Colombian soldiers murder an estimatedmore than 10,000 civiliansand pass the corpses off as “terrorists”. Given Israel’s flair for massacring civilians in the name of fighting “terrorism”, the country comparison was particularly apt. And what do you know: theroster of Nobel Peace Prize laureatesalso comprises the late Israeli politician Shimon Peres, who was co-awarded the prize in 1994 – two years before he supervised the slaughter of 106 refugees sheltering at a United Nations compound inQana, Lebanon. In 2021, Trump’s own son-in-law Jared Kushner wasnominatedfor a Nobel Peace Prize by ex-Harvard Law School professorAlan Dershowitz, who has devoted much of his legal career tojustifyingIsrael’s killing of Arab civilians. In this case, Kushner’s nomination was based on his starring role in producing theAbraham Accordsthat normalised relations between Israel and various Arab states. Now that genocide has effectively been normalised, too, Trump has proposed that the US take over the Gaza Strip, forcibly expel the native Palestinian population, and remodel the devastated territory into a brand-new “Riviera of the Middle East”. Anyway, it’s all in a day’s work for a Nobel Peace Prize nominee. In itswriteupof the Washington rendezvous – headlined “Netanyahu surprises Trump with Nobel nomination as both leaders talk of evacuating Gazans” – The Times of Israel specifies that “Netanyahu said the US and Israeli strikes against Iran had ‘changed the face of the Middle East’ and created an opportunity to expand the Abraham Accords”. After all, there’s nothing that says “fraternity between nations” like simply doing away with Palestine altogether. Reflecting on the overzealous attack on Iran that earned him the Peace Prize nomination, Trumpfavourably comparedhis action with US President Harry Truman’s decision to drop atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Of course, it should go without saying that anyone who positively invokes the nuking of hundreds of thousands of civilians should be categorically ineligible for any sort of serious peace prize. But in a world in which the supposed pursuit of peace is so often utilised as an excuse for more war, Trump’s nomination might very well be meaningful, indeed.

Zohran Mamdani cannot be boxed in,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/16/zohran-mamdani-cannot-be-boxed,,"On July 3, The New York Times published a report scrutinising a 2009 college application submitted to Columbia University by Zohran Mamdani, the winner of the Democratic party primary for mayor of New York City. The document was leaked by a hacker and showed that in a question about race and ethnicity, the applicant identified as Asian and African American. The source of the information was later revealed to be the eugenicist Jordan Lasker. Although the journalistic ethics of the article were widely questioned, it was immediately picked up by opponents in an attempt to discredit Mamdani. Did Mamdani really try to “exploit” an African American identity to get into college, as opponents have claimed? It’s worth noting that the two boxes he checked did not assist him to get into Columbia, where his father, Professor Mahmood Mamdani, is teaching African studies. Was he wrong to tick the “African American” box? There are several issues that should be brought up when considering the answer to this question. First, Mamdani was born in Uganda to a Ugandan father of Asian origin and an Indian American mother. He lived in Africa for seven years before moving to the United States. He had only a Ugandan passport until he was naturalised as a US citizen in 2018. On the Columbia University application form, like with many US universities, there is a section for voluntary self-identification of race and ethnicity. It asks if you are Hispanic or Latino (regardless of race) and then lists five other options to select one’s “race”: “American Indian or Alaskan Native”, “Asian”, “Black or African American”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander” or “white”. There is a further section for “additional optional information”. These categories are arbitrary and reductionist and cannot capture the full complexity of identity that many people around the world have, including Mamdani and myself. As a British Zambian of Asian origin whose family have lived in Zambia for three generations, I feel anxiety and frustration when having to select ethnicity checkboxes. I am regularly interrogated about my identity, which cannot be squeezed into one box on a form, or even two or three. As Mamdani himself told The New York Times: “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background.” He also explained that he wrote “Ugandan” in the application, which allowed students to provide “more specific information where relevant”. The second issue we need to keep in mind is that the history of Asian Africans – and how we fit into African societies – is complex. Between the 1860s and 1890s, the British Empire brought thousands of indentured labourers from its colony in the subcontinent to its colonies in Southern and East Africa. In the following decades, many other South Asians followed as merchants. And then, as the British partitioned the subcontinent along religious lines in the 1940s, thousands more fled the impending chaos to Africa. Once on the continent, the Asian population largely occupied a kind of middle position in which they were both victims and agents of colonial racism. In East Africa, many functioned as a subordinate ruling class, employed by the colonial police and administrators as part of a divide-and-rule strategy. In many countries, Asians enjoyed success in business during the colonial period and gained significant control of the economy. This, alongside a lack of integration, contributed to widespread anti-Asian sentiment in East Africa, seen most prominently by theexpulsionof Ugandan Asians by Idi Amin in 1972. In apartheid South Africa, people of Indian descent, the majority of whom were descendants of indentured labourers forcibly transferred by the British, were also subjected to discrimination. Prominent members of the community, such as Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed for life in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela, played a key role in the anti-apartheid struggle. Today, younger generations are still grappling with these complex identities and histories, including Mamdani himself. In his twenties, he was part of arap duo– Young Cardamon & HAB – with a Ugandan of Nubian descent. They rapped in six languages, including Luganda, Hindi and Nubi, and confronted social issues such as racism and inclusion. As a mayoral candidate of one of the most diverse cities in the world, Mamdani has much to do to address persistent anti-Blackness among Asian communities. Many Asian Africans, and other Asian communities, have internalised the white supremacy of the colonial era and the belief that being closer to whiteness offers more opportunities and privilege. Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, is the filmmaker behind Mississippi Masala, one of the first films to address this issue more than 30 years ago, with its rare depiction of an interracial relationship between a Black man and Asian African woman in the US. Her son credits this film for his existence: His mother met his father in Uganda at Makerere University while she was conducting research for the film. The third issue that needs to be considered is that this hacked information seems aimed at discrediting Mamdani, who securedfewer votesin Black neighbourhoods during the mayoral Democratic primary election. Pitting communities of colour against each other is a classic divide-and-rule tactic and a cornerstone of colonialism used to fracture alliances and weaken resistance. Its remnants can still be seen today in my country, Zambia, in areas that were historically segregated on the basis of colour. Opponents attempting to frame Mamdani as a mayor solely for South Asians – or worse, playing into and exacerbating Islamophobic sentiment – are weaponising identity to sow division and fear. Such attempts must be resisted, especially now, when the US and much of the world are facing growing authoritarianism, xenophobia and inequality. New York City is one of the places where I have some feeling of belonging; it thrives and shines in part due to its diversity and the fusion of so many cultures. In a city made up of countless stories and backgrounds, perhaps having a mayor who understands what it means to navigate multiple identities, and to live at the crossroads of belonging, might offer the kind of perspective that does not weaken leadership, but strengthens it. The story of New York has always been about reinvention. Whoever becomes mayor has the chance, and the responsibility, to redefine what progress means in one of the most diverse but unequal cities in the country. Whatever happens next, pitting communities of colour against each other serves no one.

Israel increased Rafah demolition to prepare for Gaza forced transfer plan,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/13/israel-increased-rafah-demolition-to-prepare-for-gaza-forced-transfer-plan,,"Demolition operations being conducted by Israel in Gaza’s southern Rafah Governorate have been stepped up sharply, an investigation by Al Jazeera’s Sanad investigations unit has found. Israel’s defence ministry has announced a plan to relocate 600,000 people into what observers say would be “concentration camps” in the area in southern Gaza, with plans to expand this to the Strip’s entire population. Sanad’s analysis of satellite imagery up to July 4, 2025, shows the number of demolished buildings in Rafah rising to about 28,600, up from 15,800 on April 4, 2025, according to data from the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT). This means that approximately 12,800 buildings were destroyed between early April and early July alone – a marked acceleration in demolitions that has coincided with Israel’s new push into Rafah launched in late March 2025. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, told reporters on Monday that an initial 600,000 Palestinians living in the coastal al-Mawasi area would be transferred to Rafah, the location for what he called a new “humanitarian city” for Palestinians, within 60 days of any agreed ceasefire deal. According to Katz, the entire civilian population of Gaza – more than 2 million people – will eventually be relocated to this southern city.    A proposal seen by Reuters carrying the name of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) detailed plans for a “Humanitarian Transit Area” in which Gaza residents would “temporarily reside, deradicalise, re-integrate and prepare to relocate if they wish to do so”. The minister said Israel hopes to encourage Palestinians to “voluntarily emigrate” from the Gaza Strip to other countries, adding that this plan “should be fulfilled”. He also stressed that the plan would not be run by the Israeli army, but by international bodies, without specifying which organisations would be implementing it. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) – which has been banned by Israel – warned against the latest mass forced displacement plan. “This would de facto create massive concentration camps at the border with Egypt for the Palestinians, displaced over and over across generations,” he said, adding that it would “deprive Palestinians of any prospects of a better future in their homeland”. Israeli political commentator Ori Goldberg told Al Jazeera that the plan was “for all facts and purposes a concentration camp” for Palestinians in southern Gaza, meaning that Israel is committing “what is an overt crime against humanity under international humanitarian law”. “It should be taken very seriously,” he said, and questioned the feasibility of the task of “concentrating the Palestinian population in a locked city where they would be let in but not let out”. For now, Rafah, which was once home to an estimated 275,000 people, lies largely in ruins. The scale of Israeli destruction since April this year is particularly apparent when examining specific neighbourhoods of Rafah.    Since Israelbreached the last ceasefire agreementwith Hamas on March 19, its forces have directly targeted several institutions. Sanad has identified six educational facilities that have been destroyed, including some located in the Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood, west of Rafah City. However, satellite data shows that several key facilities have been spared; 40 educational institutions – 39 schools and one university – are intact. Eight medical centres also remain standing. Sanad has concluded that this noticeable pattern of selective destruction strongly suggests that the preservation of these facilities in Rafah is unlikely to be a coincidence. Rather, it indicates that Israel aims to use these sites in the next phase of its proposed plan to displace the entire population of Gaza to Rafah. The spared educational and medical buildings already serve as critical humanitarian shelters for tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians. The war’s initial wave of displacement from northern to southern Gaza resulted in an overwhelming influx of people into the 154 UN facilities across all five governorates of the Gaza Strip, including schools, warehouses and health centres. According toUNRWA’s Situation Reportin January 2024, these facilities were by then sheltering approximately 1.4 million displaced people, an average of 9,000 people per facility, while an additional 500,000 people were receiving support from other services.    The report also notes that in some shelters, the number exceeds 12,000, four times their intended capacity. According to UNRWA’slatest reporton July 5 this year, 1.9 million people remain displaced in Gaza. Satellite imagery analysis of the Rafah area from May 2024 to May 2025 reveals that Israeli forces carried out a two-phase operation in Rafah, including in areas which had been designated for humanitarian aid distribution. Phase One began with the launch of a military offensive in May 2024, during which most buildings in targeted zones in most of eastern Rafah and parts of western Rafah were demolished. Phase Two, which began in April this year, involves the continued demolition of remaining residential buildings. This phase also included land levelling and the construction of access roads to facilitate the operation of these aid centres. British Israeli analyst Daniel Levy told Al Jazeera that Israel intends to use Rafah “as a staging post to ethnically cleanse, physically remove, as many Palestinians as possible from the landscape”. The distribution of aid, which is now under the monopoly of the controversialGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), which is run by private US contractors guarded by Israeli troops, is also “a premeditated part of a plan of social-demographic engineering to move Palestinians – to relocate, displace and kettle them,” Levy said.  Katz’s announcement came a day after Netanyahu arrived in the US to meet US President Donald Trump, as the latterpushes for a dealto end the war in Gaza and bring back the remaining Hamas-held captives. Netanyahu stressed his opposition to any deal that would ultimately leave Hamas in power in Gaza. “Twenty living hostages remain and 30 who are fallen. I am determined, we are determined, to bring back all of them,” he told reporters before boarding his plane. He added, however: “We are determined to ensure that Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel.” “That means one thing: eliminating Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. Hamas will not be there,” he said. An Israeli negotiating team was in Doha this week for indirect talks with Hamas. Trump said on Tuesday that Israel had accepted the latest ceasefire proposal, which provides for the release, in five separate stages, of 10 living and 18 dead captives, in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire, an influx of humanitarian aid to the Strip and the release of many Palestinian detainees currently held in Israeli prisons. Hamas gave what it called a “positive”responseto the proposal, stressing its reservations about the temporary nature of the proposed truce and making some demands. Netanyahu’s office called Hamas’s stipulations, concerning aid mechanisms and Israel’s military withdrawal, “unacceptable”. A sticking point remains Israel’s control of the Morag Corridor, just north of Rafah, which would allow Israel to control and isolate Rafah, facilitating the implementation of the mass expulsion plan. In his remarks on Monday, Katz said Israel would use a potential 60-day ceasefire to establish the new “humanitarian zone” south of the corridor, and that the army would hold nearly 70 percent of Gaza’s territory. Gideon Levy, Israeli columnist for Haaretz, told Al Jazeera negotiations were unlikely to result in more than a temporary ceasefire, whith the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, as “Netanyahu doesn’t want an end to the war.” While Trump could pressure his ally into a permanent deal, the US president does not seem inclined to pull his weight, observers say. “The end game is an ethnic cleansing,” Levy said. “Will it be implemented? I have my doubts. “But they are already preparing the area, and if the world is passive and the US gives its green light, it might work.”"
"Russia, Ukraine exchange more bodies of war dead, Kremlin says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/russia-ukraine-exchange-more-bodies-of-war-dead-kremlin-says,,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more bodies of their war dead, according to a Kremlin aide, as part of an agreement reached during a second round of peace talks in Turkiye last month. “Following the agreements reached in Istanbul, another 1,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers were handed over to Ukraine today,” Vladimir Medinsky, head of Russia’s delegation at the peace talks, said on Telegram on Thursday, adding that Ukraine handed over 19 slain Russian soldiers. Exchanges of captured soldiers and the repatriation of remains havetaken place regularlysince the brief renewal of peace talks in Istanbul in May in what amounts to some of the only successful diplomacy between the two sides in their more than three-year war. Medinsky posted photos on Thursday showing people in white medical suits lifting white body bags from the back of refrigerated trucks. Russia plans to return the bodies of 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and this exchange marked the beginning of that process, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported. During theirdirect meeting in Istanbul on June 2, Russia and Ukraine pledged to swap at least 1,000 soldiers on each side. Negotiators from both sides also agreed to swap all severely wounded soldiers as well as all captured fighters under the age of 25. But future talks to discuss a path to end the war have stalled as the gulf between Moscow and Kyiv has remained unchanged despite repeated pressure from United States President Donald Trump that Russia agree to a ceasefire. At the talks, Russia outlined a list of hardline demands, including for Ukraine to cede more territory and to reject all forms of Western military support. Kyiv dismissed them as unacceptable ultimatums and has questioned the point of further negotiations if Moscow is not willing to make concessions. In a further diplomatic development, another round of reunification of minors with their families in Russia and Ukraine took place on Thursday with the mediation of Qatar at its Moscow embassy. Eleven children will reunite with their families in Ukraine and three others with their families in Russia. So far, more than 100 children have reunited with their families since Qatar began facilitating the process. Ukraine said Russia took20,000 childrenduring the war and has given Moscow a list of hundreds who, they said, were taken from Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions since 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin faceswar crime chargesbefore the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the alleged “unlawful deportation and transfer of children”. Before the latest prisoner exchange, a Russian air strike on a shopping centre and market in Dobropillia in eastern Ukraine killed at least two people, wounded 22 and caused widespread damage on Wednesday, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Filashkin said the building was struck by a 500kg (1,100lb) bomb. In its latest overnight attacks, Russia launched 400 Shahed and decoy drones as well as one ballistic missile, the Ukrainian air force said. The strikes targeted the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the central city of Kryvyi Rih, Vinnytsia in the west and Odesa in the south. The Russian Ministry of Defence announced that its forces had captured the settlements of Popiv Yar in the eastern region of Donetsk, Degtiarne in Kharkiv in the northeast and Kamianske in Zaporizhia in the south. In the meantime, Ukraine’s economy minister, and key negotiator in the US mineral deal, Yuliia Svyrydenko, was appointed as the country’s new prime minister Thursday. She is Ukraine’s first new head of government since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022."

Clashes erupt again in Syria’s Suwayda between Bedouin and Druze fighters,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/israel-reportedly-targets-bedouin-convoy-in-syria-after-attacks,,"Heavy fighting has flared up again between the Druze and Bedouin tribes in the restive southern Syrian province of Suwayda, as another ceasefire has collapsed a day after Syrian troops pulled out of the area. The resumption of clashes on Friday came as the Syrian Ministry of Interior denied reports that government forces are being redeployed to the Druze-majority governorate. “We confirm that no official statement has been issued in this regard, and we categorically deny the veracity of what was published,” state media quoted spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba as saying. The spokesperson said government forces were in a normal state of readiness, and there had been no deployment to Suwayda so far. Israel, which on Wednesday carried outheavy air attackson Suwayda and the capital, Damascus, had previously warned the Syrian government to withdraw from the south. Syria’s government condemned the Israeli attacks as a violation of Syrian sovereignty and an attempt to sow division and chaos in the country.    On Friday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported renewed clashes west of the southern city “pitting tribal fighters and Bedouin supported by the authorities on one side, against Druze fighters on the other”. The AFP news agency also said fighters on both sides confirmed the exchange of fire to its correspondents. Separately, footage published online and verified by Al Jazeera documented the sound of clashes between Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters in rural Suwayda earlier today. Other verified clips also showed the arrival of reinforcements to support the tribesmen spread throughout the area. Earlier, a video showed Bedouin tribal leader Abdul Moneim al-Naseef, surrounded by armed tribesman, issuing a call “to the tribes in all Syrian provinces to head immediately to Suwayda to save our people from massacres and ethnic cleansing”. The latest reports of violence come despite a ceasefire agreed on Wednesday and the pulling out of government forces from Suwayda, where dozens of people were killed in days of clashes involving local armed groups as well as government forces. The conflict drew air attacks against Syrian forces by Israel, which claimed its attacks aimed to protect the Druze community in Suwayda. Most of the fighting was halted by a truce announced on Wednesday. Under that agreement, Druze factions and scholars would be left to maintain internal security in Suwayda, Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said on Thursday.    Reporting from Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the situation represented a “very dangerous escalation” as Syria navigates a fragile post-war transition, following the toppling of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December last year. “It is an old fault line between Bedouin tribes and some Druze factions, and there have been bouts of violence since the fall of the regime … But this time around, it is a different situation because Bedouin tribes are calling for the state’s intervention,” Khodr said. “The big question is what will Israel do. It has said it will not allow the presence of government forces in the south,” she added. Later on Friday, an Israeli official, who declined to be named, told reporters that “in light of the ongoing instability in southwest Syria, Israel has agreed to allow limited entry of the [Syrian] internal security forces into Suwayda district for the next 48 hours.” There was no immediate reaction from the Syrian government. Meanwhile, the United Nations Human Rights Office on Friday said credible reports indicate widespread rights violations have been committed by all factions fighting in Suwayda – including summary executions, arbitrary killings, kidnappings, destruction and looting of homes. Among the reported perpetrators were members of the security forces, government-affiliated elements, as well as Druze and Bedouins, it added. “This bloodshed and the violence must stop, and the protection of all people must be the utmost priority, in line with international human rights law,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said. The UN refugee agency added it is “very concerned” about the effect of hostilities in Suwayda on its aid operations. “It is very difficult for us to operate there … at the moment, our capacity to deliver aid is very limited. We are calling on all parties to allow humanitarian access,” spokesperson William Spindler told reporters in Geneva on Friday."

"Israel kills 30 in Gaza attacks, using ‘drone missiles packed with nails’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/israel-kills-18-in-attacks-using-drone-missiles-packed-with-nails,,"At least 30 Palestinians have been killed since dawn across Gaza in Israeli attacks, medical sources have told Al Jazeera, as the besieged and bombarded enclave’s decimated health system, overwhelmed by a daily flow of wounded, is forcing doctors to make decisions on who to treat first. In the latest killings on Friday, three people died in an Israeli attack on the Tuffah neighbourhood of eastern Gaza City. Five people were also killed in an Israeli air attack in Jabalia an-Nazla, in northern Gaza. Earlier, an Israeli attack hit tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in al-Mawasi, southern Gaza – previously designated a so-called “safe zone” – igniting a major fire and killing at least five people, including infants. Al-Mawasi has come under repeated, deadly Israeli fire. The death toll also includes includes seven people who were desperately seeking aid. Al Jazeera’s correspondent Hani Mahmoud said the injured, including children, were transferred to Nasser Hospital. Some showed wounds compatible with drone attacks. “Drone missiles are packed with nails, metals and shrapnel that explodes at high speed, causing internal bleeding,” Mahmoud said. “These attacks are on the rise and target people in large crowds, in markets or while queueing for water. “While Israel claims to be using sophisticated weapons, when we look on the ground, we see the number of casualties contradicting what Israel is [saying],” he added. Israel’s ongoing, punishing blockade of Gaza is forcing doctors in crammed medical facilities to make difficult decisions about who to treat. Patients with chronic illnesses are often the first to miss out because emergency departments are overwhelmed by people wounded in Israeli attacks. “Before the war, I used to receive dialysis three times a week, with each session lasting four hours. At that time, the situation was stable, the treatment was effective, and we would return home feeling well and rested,” Omda Dagmash, a dialysis patient, told Al Jazeera at the barely functioning al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “Now we can barely make the journey to the hospital, particularly since we are not eating well.” At al-Shifa, the dialysis schedule has been scaled down to shorter and less frequent sessions. For some, it is a matter of life and death. “The journey here is long and costly,” said Rowaida Minyawi, an elderly patient. “After all this exhaustion, we sometimes can’t find treatment. I have heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Even the medicine we get is not good. What should we do? Die at home?” Besides prioritising patients, healthcare workers say they have to scale back operations to the minimum, as no fuel means no power – and no way to save lives. “Only a few departments are working. We had to cut electricity to the rest,” said Ziad Abu Humaidan, from the hospital’s engineering department. “The hospital’s yards turned into graveyards rather than a place of care and healing. Without electricity, there is no lighting, no functioning medical equipment, and no support for other essential services.” The Palestinian Ministry of Health said unprecedented numbers of starving people of all ages were arriving at emergency departments with extreme exhaustion and fatigue. It said hundreds were “emaciated” and at risk of death due to malnutrition. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, said patients were “suffering from stress and memory loss resulting from severe hunger.” According to a public opinion survey conducted by the Israeli news outlet Maariv, about 44 percent of the Israeli public said the continued war in Gaza will not achieve the country’s goals. A total of 42 percent of those surveyed said they believe the fighting will lead to achieving the goals, while 11 percent of the respondents said they are undecided. Maariv also noted that of those who support the current coalition government, 73 percent think the military will achieve its goals, while 70 percent of opposition supporters think otherwise. In the meantime, Israel faced a rare backlash after it bombed Gaza’sonly Catholic church, killing three people and wounding at least 10 on Thursday. United States President Donald Trump contacted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after having “not a positive reaction” to the strike, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. After the call, Netanyahu attributed the strike to “stray ammunition” and added that Israel was investigating the incident. Netanyahu called Pope Leo on Friday, the Vatican said. During the call, the pontiff renewed his appeal for a ceasefire and an end to the war in Gaza, and expressed his concern over the “dramatic” humanitarian situation in the enclave, a Vatican statement said. Leo also stressed the urgent need to protect places of worship, the faithful, and all people in the Palestinian territories and Israel, the statement added. Hamas slammed the attack as “a new crime committed against places of worship and innocent displaced persons” that comes in the context of a “war of extermination against the Palestinian people”. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, and Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III entered Gaza on Friday to express the “shared pastoral solicitude of the Churches of the Holy Land,” read a statement released by the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The patriarchs and their delegation visited the Holy Family Catholic Church, the site of the Israeli attack."
UK to lower voting age to 16 in major electoral reform,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/uk-to-lower-voting-age-to-16-in-major-electoral-reform,,"The United Kingdom is to lower its voting age in general elections from 18 to 16, giving the country one of the lowest voting ages in the world in what the government says is a bid to “modernise our democracy”. The centre-left Labour government announced the plans on Thursday, following through on a campaign pledge it made before coming to power last year. The move is one of several planned changes to voting rules in a bid to improve democratic participation and remove barriers to voting. “I think it’s really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote, because they are old enough to go out to work, they are old enough to pay taxes, so [they] pay in,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. “I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go,” Starmer added. There are currently about 1.6 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the UK. The change, which will still require the government to bring legislation before Parliament, where it has a comfortable majority, will align voting ages across the UK. Currently, 16-year-olds in Wales and Scotland can vote in the devolved Welsh and Scottish parliaments, respectively, as well as in local elections, but not in the UK’s general elections. Globally, most countries have a voting age of 18, although some countries like Austria, Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador allow for voting in national elections at age 16. Belgium, Germany and Malta allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures. Other planned changes include introducing automated voter registration and making UK-issued bank cards an accepted form of ID at polling stations. The latter change has been made in response to a requirement introduced by the previous Conservative government for voters to show a photo ID, which the Electoral Commission claimed had prevented about 750,000 people from voting in the 2024 election. Voter turnout in that election was 59.7 percent, the lowest level since 2001. “For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,” Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. “We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in UK democracy.” The opposition Conservative Party criticised the changes to the voting age, with Paul Holmes, the party’s spokesperson on community issues, calling the policy “hopelessly confusing” about the age of majority. “Why does this Government think a 16-year-old can vote but not be allowed to buy a lottery ticket, an alcoholic drink, marry, or go to war, or even stand in the elections they’re voting in?” he said in the House of Commons, Press Association Media reported. But others applauded the move. Naomi Smith, chief executive of civil society campaign group Best for Britain, said the change was “a brave choice set to benefit generations to come”. Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, said he backed the move, the AFP news agency reported. “Our democracy is in crisis, and we risk reaching a tipping point where politics loses its legitimacy,” he said."
"Contrary to India’s fears, Bangladesh is not joining a China-Pakistan axis",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/17/contrary-to-indias-fears-bangladesh-is-not-joining-a-china-pakistan-axis,,"On July 8, Indian Chief of Defence Staff Anil Chauhan delivered a pointed message at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, raising alarms over a budding alignment of strategic interests between China, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The general cautioned that such a trilateral convergence, if it gains traction, could have serious implications for India’s security and disrupt the regional balance of power. His remarks came in the wake of a widely circulated photograph from Kunming, China, showing diplomats from the three nations meeting during the inaugural trilateral talks held alongside regional economic forums. While the meeting was officially billed as a diplomatic engagement, the image has sent ripples through India’s strategic community. Bangladesh, clearly aware of the sensitivities involved, has moved swiftly to contain the narrative. Touhid Hossain, foreign affairs adviser to Dhaka’s interim government, publicly disavowed any intention of joining bloc-based or adversarial alliances. Dhaka reiterated that its foreign policy remains firmly nonaligned and anchored in sovereign autonomy. Despite these assurances, New Delhi’s strategic calculus appears to be shifting. There is now a growing perception in New Delhi that, under the interim leadership of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh may be recalibrating its foreign policy, moving away from the overt closeness seen under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Under Hasina, India and Bangladesh enjoyed unusually warm ties characterised by deep security cooperation, cross-border connectivity projects and shared regional objectives. Dhaka took strong action against anti-India insurgents, gave India access to transit routes through Bangladeshi territory and generally aligned itself with New Delhi’s strategic priorities. Whether real or perceived, this shift is influencing how India reads the regional landscape. Chauhan also drew attention to a broader, troubling pattern: External powers – chiefly China – are leveraging economic fragilities across the Indian Ocean region to deepen their influence. With countries such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan increasingly beholden to Chinese investment and aid, concerns are mounting that Beijing is systematically encircling India through soft-power entrenchment. Bangladesh’s case, however, remains somewhat unique. Its economy, though under pressure, is relatively resilient, and Dhaka continues to emphasise pragmatic, interest-driven diplomacy over ideological alignment. The Kunming meeting, while symbolically charged, does not yet represent a formal strategic realignment. Still, the formation of a trilateral framework marks a significant development. Unlike previous bilateral engagements, this format introduces a new dimension of coordination that could evolve in unpredictable ways. The echoes of history are hard to ignore. In the 1960s, China and Pakistan maintained a tight strategic axis that tacitly encompassed East Pakistan – what is now Bangladesh. That configuration unravelled in 1971 with Bangladesh’s independence. Today, however, subtle signs suggest elements of that strategic triad may be resurfacing – this time in a more complex geopolitical theatre. For Beijing, deepening ties with both Pakistan and Bangladesh serves its broader objective of consolidating influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. For Islamabad, it provides a layer of diplomatic insulation and strategic leverage. For Dhaka, the relationship is more tactical – an attempt to hedge against regional volatility at a time when its once-stable ties with New Delhi appear increasingly uncertain. Bangladesh’s cautious posture is also shaped by volatile domestic politics. Since the July protests and the installation of an interim administration, internal cohesion has frayed. Polarisation is resurging, and with national elections looming in early 2026, the government’s priority is stability, not strategy. Foreign policy in this climate is reactive – not transformative. Dhaka understands the risks of leaning too far in any direction. Lingering historical resentments with Pakistan remain politically sensitive while an overreliance on China would strain crucial trade and diplomatic ties with the West, especially the United States, where concerns over democratic backsliding and human rights have sharpened. In this context, any overt strategic alignment could invite unnecessary scrutiny and backlash. The Kunming meeting, despite its symbolism, was primarily economic in focus – touching on trade, connectivity, infrastructure and cultural cooperation. However, when China and Pakistan floated the proposal to institutionalise trilateral cooperation through a joint working group, Bangladesh demurred. This was not indecision. It was a deliberate, calculated refusal. Dhaka’s foreign policy has long been defined by “engagement without entanglement”. It maintains open channels with all major powers while avoiding the traps of bloc politics. This nonaligned posture is a core principle guiding its diplomacy. Bangladesh welcomes dialogue and economic cooperation, but it draws a firm line at military or strategic alignment. For India, interpreting Bangladesh’s moves requires nuance. While Dhaka continues to broaden its international partnerships, it has not abandoned its critical role in India’s security calculus, particularly in the northeastern region. The challenge for New Delhi is not just to monitor emerging partnerships but to reinforce the value of its own. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, security cooperation between New Delhi and Dhaka under Hasina’s Awami League was pivotal in stabilising the border region. Bangladesh’s decisive crackdown on militant groups, coupled with close coordination with Indian intelligence and security agencies, played a crucial role in suppressing insurgent threats. Today, with India’s ties to both China and Pakistan under severe strain, any perceived shift in Dhaka’s stance is scrutinised intensely in New Delhi. The fear that Beijing and Islamabad might exploit Bangladesh as a strategic lever to apply asymmetric pressure remains deeply ingrained in India’s security mindset. Yet, Bangladesh’s explicit rejection of the proposed trilateral working group reveals a clear-eyed understanding of these sensitivities. It underscores Dhaka’s intent to steer clear of actions that could escalate regional tensions. This evolving dynamic poses a dual challenge for India: It demands a recalibrated response that moves beyond reactive defensiveness. New Delhi must embrace a more sophisticated, forward-looking strategy – one that transcends old political loyalties and adapts to the shifting diplomatic contours of South Asia.

Marathon record-holder Ruth Chepngetich suspended for positive doping test,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/marathon-world-record-holder-chepngetich-suspended-for-positive-doping-test,,"Women’s marathon world record-holder Ruth Chepngetich has been provisionally suspended for a positive doping test. Track and field’s Athletics Integrity Unit said on Thursday that Chepngetich tested positive for a banned diuretic and masking agent in March and “opted for a voluntary provisional suspension while the AIU’s investigation was ongoing.” The Kenyan runner set the world record by almost two minutes at the Chicago Marathon last October in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 56 seconds. It was her third win in Chicago. She also won the marathon at the 2019 world championships in Qatar, where the women’s race started at midnight to avoid extreme daytime heat. The AIU gave no timetable for a disciplinary case for the 30-year-old runner. Chepngetich was interviewed in person in Kenya in April and “complied with requests regarding our investigation”, AIU official Brett Clothier said in a statement. The substance Chepngetich tested positive for, hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ, can be used to disguise the use of performance-enhancing drugs."
Why Manny Pacquiao is boxing again for world title against Mario Barrios,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/why-manny-pacquiao-is-boxing-again-for-world-title-against-mario-barrios,,"Four years after his last fight ended in a disappointing loss, the legendary Manny Pacquiao is back in the ring and challenging for another world title. The 46-year-old will face WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios on Saturday – but questions remain as to whether Pacquiao, widely regarded as one of the best boxers in history, can mount a serious challenge at such an advanced age. Here’s what you need to know about the living legend’s boxing comeback against Barrios: Pacquiao, a Hall of Famer boxer, shrugged off concerns about his comeback and says he understands the risks of reentering the ring against a competitor like Barrios: A man 16 years his junior, 16cm (6.3in) taller, and the two-time reigning WBC welterweight title holder at the peak of his powers. “I’m coming back because boxing is my passion,” Pacquiao said in an interview with ESPN. “It’s all I think about, and I really like to make history.” The Filipino icon says this is not a one-off fight but rather a first step in an extended return to boxing. Pacquiao claims his motivation to fight again is primarily about preserving his competitive legacy rather than money. “I’m worried for my reputation,” Pacquiao said in an interview with the BBC. “But I’m making sure that I’m not a kind of fighter like other fighters that come back but they are not showing what they did before.” A loss for Pacquiao against Barrios would likely be the final nail in the coffin of a superlative boxing career. A win would be a 13th world championship for the charismatic fighter and add to his already stellar boxing resume. Broader medical concerns over middle-aged boxers reentering the ring, especially after a long lay-off, have been raised, although medical checks were made on the fighters in the lead-up to the bout. The fight is scheduled for Saturday, July 19. Pacquiao and Barrios are expected to undertake their ring walks at 8pm (03:00 GMT on Sunday). The fight will begin shortly thereafter. The main undercard begins at 5pm (00:00 GMT on Sunday). Pacquiao vs Barrios will take place at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The venue can host more than 16,000 spectators, making it one of the largest boxing venues in the United States. The American is the clear bookmakers’ favourite to retain his world championship title. “In so many of my fights I was the underdog, and I surprised them… Manny always brings surprises,” Pacquiao said. The Filipino living legend has won 12 major world championships. He is the only competitor to win world titles in eight different weight divisions, more than any other boxer in history. His longevity in the sport is equally legendary as the only fighter to capture or retain world titles across four different decades: The 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. In June, Pacquiao was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, becoming the third Filipino boxer to receive the honour. Pacquiao’s last professional fight was a decision loss against Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugas in 2021 for the WBA world welterweight championship. His last professional win was six years ago against Keith Thurman, when he became the oldest welterweight champion in history. The 30-year-old American will be defending the WBC title for the second time. His last fight was a split draw decision against Abel Ramos on November 15. Pacquiao, who turns 47 in December, feels rejuvenated after four years away from the ring and said he was returning for another opportunity to make history. “I’m enjoying training camp as much as I did when I was 26 or 29 years old. The motivation to train hard and the discipline are the same,” Pacquiao said at Wednesday’s news conference. “I mean, it’s because I’ve been away from boxing why I’m still interested and passionate about fighting. “I cannot imagine that I am still fighting here in the Grand Arena after 24 years. It’s a blessing, a favour from God, and I’m so thankful to be here, still fighting and putting on a good show for the fans,” he said. “Manny has been doing this his whole life and understands what it takes to go in there,” Barrios said. “And he’s trying to be great. He’s trying to do something, fighting for a title at his age – and as a fighter, I have nothing but respect for that. “You know, Manny is a very likeable person. I can’t think of anything bad to say about him other than, you know, he’s facing me for my title. “At the end of the day, he’s just another man in there. He’s another opponent trying to take my title, regardless of everything he’s accomplished and given to the sport,” Barrios added on Wednesday. The prize money has not been disclosed. It has been reported that Pacquiao will make up to $5m for this bout – in line with similar payments in his last two fights – with Barrios earning up to $1m.

"Tour de France pauses for Privitera, who died after Italy crash",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/tour-de-france-pauses-for-privitera-who-died-after-italy-crash-aged-19,,"Tour de France riders applauded for a minute before the 12th stage of their race today in memory of Samuele Privitera, a 19-year-old Italian cyclist who died after a crash while racing in Italy. Privitera crashed in the first stage of the Tour of Valle D’Aosta in the northwestern municipality of Pontey on Wednesday. Race organisers said the circumstances of the accident were “still unclear and are being investigated by public safety authorities”. “It’s really sad to lose another young talent today, it’s devastating,” Tour de France favourite Tadej Pogacar, who crashed on Wednesday, said before Thursday’s stage. “It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world, I think, and the risk that we are taking sometimes is too far. But I’m really really really sad for all his family. May he rest in peace.” Privitera was a member of the Hagens Berman Jayco team, the development team for Jayco AlUla, which is racing at the Tour de France and whose members, including Ben O’Connor, wore black armbands. “Samuele was and always will be the life and personality of this team,” Hagens Berman Jayco team director Axel Merckx said in a statement. “This team has always been a small family, and moments like this are unimaginable. He was irreplaceable. His joy, his spirit, his kindness, was always a bright light to whatever room or race that he was in at that moment. To lose him is devastating beyond words.” Italian media reports said Privitera crashed on a descent about 35km (22 miles) from the finish in Aosta at a speed of almost 43mph (70km/h). He reportedly lost his helmet and crashed into a barrier. The second stage of the Tour of Valle D’Aosta was cancelled, and participating teams were being given a choice whether to continue with the third stage on Friday."
Arsenal sign Liverpool striker Olivia Smith in world-record women’s fee,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/arsenal-sign-canadas-olivia-smith-in-world-record-womens-fee,,"Canada forward Olivia Smith has signed for Arsenal in a world record fee believed to be $1.34m. Arsenal signed Smith from Liverpool on Thursday to make the 20-year-old, who made her international debut at 15, the first million-pound women’s footballer. That fee would surpass the $1.1m Chelsea paid when signing Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January, which set a new benchmark in women’s football. “She’s one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here at the club,” Arsenal director of women’s football Clare Wheatley said. Smith’s move highlights the increase in spending in women’s football, with transfer records being broken regularly in recent times. Zambia striker Rachael Kundananji joined Bay FC from Madrid CFF fora record $788,000last year, and that figure was quickly exceeded by Girma’s move to Chelsea. “It’s a privilege and an honour to sign for Arsenal,” said Smith. “It’s my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe, and I’m excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal.” The investment in women’s football in the English top flight has started to be matched by that of the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL). Kundananji’s move to Bay FC came only two weeks after Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala, who won the African Footballer of the Year award for the sixth time in 2023, signed for the San Francisco-based club from Barcelona. Smith’s transfer more than doubles the record $500,000 fee that Chelsea paid only last January to Spanish club Levante for Maya Ramirez."
India’s ban on Jane Street raises concerns over regulator role,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/18/indias-ban-on-jane-street-raises-concerns-over-regulator-role,,"Indian tax authorities and market regulator are considering widening their probe of United States trading giant Jane Street Group to investigate it for tax evasion in addition to an earlier charge of price rigging in the Bombay Stock Exchange’s benchmark Sensex, according to media reports. The tax evasion charge comes on the heels of market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), seizing 48.43 billion rupees ($570m) and banning four Jane Street-related entities from operating in the market for alleged price manipulation in the National Stock Exchange (NSE). SEBI’s order has roiled the Indian markets, raising questions about regulator surveillance and investor protection in the world’s largest options trading market. Trading in India’s weekly equity index options has slumped by a third on the ban on Jane Street, the Reuters news agency reported on Thursday. Trading of equity options lets investors buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price and date. As the Indian market rapidly grew to handle more than half of all global options trades, retail investors entered the market too. Questions of price manipulation have dogged this rapid rise but remained vacuous until a New York court case in April 2024, where Jane Street alleged that its rival, Millennium Partners, had stolen its algorithms that helped it make in the Indian options market. A whistleblower, Mayank Bansal, then made presentations to SEBI showing Jane Street’s trading patterns. Bansal had agreed to speak to Al Jazeera about his interaction with SEBI on the matter, but then backtracked. On July 3, in a detailed interim order, the regulator said that “by preponderance of probability, there is no economic rationale that can account for this sudden burst of large and aggressive activity … other than the intent to manipulate the price of securities and index benchmark”. SEBI has alleged that Jane Street accumulated large long positions in stocks that are a part of the NSE’s Bank Index and built large short positions in index options at the start of trade. Around market closing time, it would reverse its trades in the cash and futures segments, pushing down the index and earning large profits in the options segment. This activity was blurred by its offshore entities making some of these trades. “Lawyers [can] push back with SEBI on jurisdiction-related issues, but when underlying [Indian] securities are issued, SEBI can take action,” Joby Mathew, managing partner at the law firm Joby Mathew and Associates and a former legal officer at SEBI, told Al Jazeera. Jane Street has disputed SEBI’s findings and has hired lawyers to represent it before SEBI in the case. It has deposited the 48.43 billion rupees ($563m) of allegedly ill-gotten gains in an account pending the investigation and final report. “Such processes typically take eight to 24 months,” especially in “complex manipulation cases”, Sumit Agarwal, a former SEBI officer and cofounder of Regstreet Law Advisors, told Al Jazeera in an emailed response. But the investigation can only be part of a broader questioning of Jane Street and the regulator’s role in identifying and curbing such trades sooner and protecting retail investors. As India’s options market grew, retail investors were drawn to it, enticed by the growing volumes, the prospect of quick gains and less fettered trades than the equities market, where a rapidly rising stock could hit circuit breakers, leading to a halt in trading to prevent manipulation. Mathew says his clients from the options trading segment range from students to award-winning cardiologists who may not have a refined knowledge of the market but were sold on the idea by traders or social media influencers. Most ended up losing money. Deven Choksey, managing director at the Mumbai-based stock brokerage KR Choksey Shares and Securities, says retail investors form nearly half the Indian options market, while Jane Street and other sophisticated institutions form a little more. “It’s like a bullock cart facing a race car. Their meeting is bound to cause accidents.” If Jane Street is found to have manipulated the market, its earnings would have come through losses for retail investors. Bhargavi Zaveri, a financial regulations researcher formerly at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy and currently a doctoral researcher at the National University of Singapore, says retail investors have made losses in the options segment, but the total amount is not clear. Identifying and compensating investors can be hard in such cases. So even if the final order goes against Jane Street and the 48.43 billion rupees fine goes into an investor protection fund, it may be hard to distribute it onwards to retail investors who incurred losses. The best protection may be to stem irregular trades early, experts say. “SEBI has a surveillance system and they can well monitor the markets in a timely way.,” says Choksey. SEBI’s interim order is based on trades made by Jane Street between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2025, a period in which retail investors may have incurred substantial losses, going by SEBI’s estimates. Regstreet’s Agarwal says, “SEBI’s own 2024 consultations flagged expiry day options as highly speculative and volatile.” India has fortnightly expiry dates for options, which is when they have to be settled. That is when Jane Street allegedly manipulated prices. In a February 6 letter, SEBI told Jane Street, “The above trading activity prima facie appears to be fraudulent and manipulative.” But it did not issue its order curbing Jane Street until July 3. SEBI’s recent measures limiting weekly expiries, tightening spreads and higher margins “reflect a push for greater protection” for retail investors, Agarwal says. But the best way to protect retail investors would be to have them trade separately from proprietary trading firms in the options segment, Choksey points out. “India is unique … and in no market will you see so many retail investors. So, SEBI must create product differentiation by customer segment.” to protect retail investors Chiksey says. In an internal email, Jane Street reportedly told employees it was using “basic index arbitrage trading” and called SEBI’s allegations “extremely inflammatory”. It has hired Mumbai-based law firm, Khaitan and Co, to represent it before SEBI. Proving price manipulation involves showing intent, which can be hard, and experts are divided on whether a SEBI investigation will be able to demonstrate that. “Trading to incur losses makes no sense, and so it indicates manipulation,” says Mathew, the former legal officer. But NUS’s Zaveri says it is not so clear. “I think three problems are being conflated here. One, the size of the options segment being manifold the underlying cash segment. Two, that retail investors have made losses on the options segment, which I’m not sure have been quantified. Three, Jane Street arbitraged between an illiquid cash and highly liquid options segment.” According to her, the three occurrences may not prove the intent to manipulate. Under Indian law, proving manipulation is challenging and “Jane Street can argue its expiry day trades were legitimate index arbitrage recognised by regulators, making a manipulation finding difficult without clear intent evidence,” Regstreet’s Agarwal says. Any action by SEBI could affect Jane Street’s reputation. Last month, an investigation by Bloomberg found that Jane Street cofounder Robert Granieri was duped into funding weapons for an attempted coup to overthrow the government in South Sudan. If SEBI’s final order lays out any action against Jane Street, “they may well have to disclose it in their filings, which will affect them elsewhere in the world”, says Mathew."
Tesla launches Model Y in India with elevated price tag amid high tariffs,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/15/tesla-launches-model-y-in-india-with-elevated-price-tag-amid-high-tariffs,,"Tesla has launched its Model Y in India for about $70,000, a significant markup relative to its other major markets, reflecting the country’s high tariffs on electric vehicle imports, whichCEO Elon Muskhas long criticised. The electric carmaker announced the price on Tuesday. Deliveries are estimated to start from the third quarter, the US automaker is targeting a niche electric vehicle segment in India that accounts for just 4 percent of overall sales in the world’s third-largest car market. It will compete mainly with German luxury giants such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and South Korea’s Kia rather than domestic mass-market EV players such as Tata Motors and Mahindra Auto. On Tuesday, Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai and began taking Model Y orders on its website, marking its long-awaited entry into the market where Musk once had plans to open a factory. For now, Tesla will import cars into a country where tariffs and related duties can exceed 100 percent, driving up the price for consumers. Tesla’s Model Y rear-wheel drive is priced at about $70,000 (6 million rupees), while its Model Y long-range rear-wheel drive costs roughly $79,000 (6.8 million rupees), according to the website. The prices include the tariff and additional levies imposed by the state. There was no breakdown of the price on the website and Reuters could not immediately ascertain the listing price. They compare with a starting price from $44,990 in the US, $36,700 (263,500 yuan) in China, and $53,700 (45,970 euros) in Germany. At the media-only event at the showroom, Tesla displayed two Model Y cars made in China and its supercharger, which it will install at eight different locations in Mumbai and in and around New Delhi, where it is also expected to open its next showroom.    “We are here to create the ecosystem, to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including the charging infrastructure,” Isabel Fan, a regional director at Tesla, said at the launch event. “We are building from 0 to 100. It will take time to cover the whole country.” Grappling with excess capacity in global factories and declining sales, Tesla has adopted a strategy of selling imported vehicles in India, despite the duties and levies. The US EV maker has long lobbied India for lower import tariffs on cars, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s officials remain in talks with US President Donald Trump’s administration to lower the levies under a bilateral trade deal. Tesla’s US factoriesalso do not currently make the right-hand drive vehicles that are used in India.    Although India’s road infrastructure has improved, traffic discipline – like lane driving – is still rudimentary, EV chargers are far and few and stray animals, including cattle, and potholes on the road are a big hurdle, even in cities. “In the future, we wish to see R&D and manufacturing done in India, and I am sure at an appropriate stage, Tesla will think about it,” Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters outside the new Tesla outlet."

Wyoming's mining advocates see profit and peril under Trump,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/7/16/in-wyomings-mining-industry-advocates-see-profit-and-peril-under-trump,,"Wyoming’s population makes up just 0.17 percent of the United States population. But when it comes to mining resources, the Cowboy State punches well above its weight. Nearly 40 percent of US coal production comes from the vast northern state. And the world's largest reserve of trona — a salt crystal used in everything from glass to plastic to paper manufacturing — is situated in the state's southwest corner. So, when US President Donald Trump emerged triumphant in the2024 presidential election, mining industry leaders welcomed his return to the White House. Trump had campaigned for a second term on the promise that he would lift cumbersome regulations on mining and energy exploration. And Wyoming responded by voting for him by the widest margin of any state for the third election in a row. But while industry advocates have expressed excitement about the first months of Trump's second term, some fear hiscampaign of regulation-slashingmight come at the expense of mine workers themselves."
Barcelona talks with DR Congo leaked ahead of new sponsorship deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/barcelona-talks-with-dr-congo-leaks-ahead-of-new-sponsorship-deal,,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) has agreed to pay more than $46.37m in a sponsorship deal with Spanish football club Barcelona that would see a logo promoting tourism appear on some team apparel, according to a contract seen by Reuters. The contract with Barcelona, seen on Thursday by the news agency, is dated June 29 and stipulates that a logo branding the war-hit Central African country as the “heart of Africa” will appear on the backs of training and warm-up jerseys for the men’s and women’s teams. The logo will also appear in advertising for the club and in the club magazine and annual report, the contract says. DR Congo will pay the club between $11.6m and $13.3m annually over the next four seasons, it says. Details of the deal between DR Congo and Barcelona have not been announced. AS Monaco and AC Milan last month also announced sponsorship deals with DR Congo without disclosing the amounts.  DR Congo’s Sports Minister Didier Budimbu told Reuters the contract with AS Monaco is worth $1.85m per season. He did not disclose the amounts for the contracts with AC Milan or Barcelona. A government source said the contract with AC Milan was worth $16.2m per season. DR Congo’s Ministry of Tourism did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, while Barcelona told Reuters they had no comment at this time. In February, DR Congo’s Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner urged football clubs Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain to end their “blood-stained” sponsorship agreements with “Visit Rwanda”. The appeal came less than a week after M23 rebels seized eastern DR Congo’s biggest city, Goma, as part of a lightning advance. Rwanda denies backing M23, saying it is defending itself. A report by a group of United Nations experts obtained by Reuters this month said Kigali exercised command and control over the rebels during their advance, gaining political influence and access to mineral-rich territory."
"In Belgium, a mother fears for her children under Israel’s bombs in Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/14/in-belgium-a-mother-fears-for-her-children-under-israels-bombs-in-gaza,,"Every nook and corner of Rawan Alkatari’s home in Aalst, a city in Belgium, is filled with pictures that remind her of her family in Gaza. “People who come to visit my home say it is beautiful. But I’ll see it as beautiful when it is filled with the sound of my children,” she said. The 30-year-old came to Belgium shortly beforeIsrael’s war on Gazabegan in October 2023, having been granted asylum. But her husband Osama and three children – Lujayn, Lama and Omar, aged 14, 12 and eight, respectively – have been unable to join her, despite Belgium having approved their family reunification visas. “My husband and children got their family reunification visas approved [by Belgium] on October 1, 2024, but remain stuck in Gaza. Their visas also expire in October this year,” she told Al Jazeera. “Right now, my family’s documents are at the Belgian embassy in Cairo in Egypt. Belgium says it has submitted their names for evacuation and is awaiting Israeli approval, while Israel says it hasn’t received anything. So, who is responsible? I honestly don’t know,” she said. Alkatari is being supported by an Israel-based organisation, which has contacted COGAT, the Israeli army’s aid coordination agency, regarding her case. COGAT told the group in June that a request for her family’s evacuation had not been received, she said, referring to emails seen by Al Jazeera. Alkatari’s home in Gaza City has been destroyed. Her family has been displaced more than four times. They currently live in an overcrowded encampment inal-Mawasiin Gaza’s Khan Younis. Israel had designated al-Mawasi as a humanitarian safe zone in December 2023, but has repeatedly attacked the area since then. “Every day, bombs fall around their tents, and they watch people die. They are also living in a miserable tent with not enough food, no medicines and no safe bathrooms,” she said, adding that fever, hepatitis, and skin diseases are rampant in the camp. Rodents, weasels, and snakes crawl around as people sleep, she said. In Belgium, guilt-stricken and concerned about her family’s plight, she struggles to eat or drink. “My children beg me to eat. I went out once to get something to eat. I looked at the supermarket and thought, ‘How am I going to eat when they’re hungry?’ My children no longer look the same when I speak to them over video calls. Their faces are pale and yellow from malnutrition. My husband has also aged so much. His hair and beard have turned completely white,” she said. The European Union allows asylum seekers who have been granted international protection in any member state to bring their spouse, children and certain other family members under the bloc’s Family Reunification Directive. In Belgium, one in four visas were given to members of a refugee’s family last year, local broadcaster VRT NWS reported in January. Refugee family reunification visas increased to 5,714 in 2024 from 3,700 in 2023. But for refugees from Gaza, Belgium can “only provide consular assistance and register on an evacuation list Belgians and foreigners who have a refugee status in Belgium, as well as the members of their nuclear family”,according tothe Immigration Department. Alkatari is not convinced. “Some families I know have also left for other countries via the Kerem Shalom [crossing] in Israel. So there are options, but there seems to be a clear failure to care for us,” she said, adding that the cases she has heard of include families with Belgian visas and some who have reached other European countries on medical evacuations. Nearby, 37 people arrived in France on July 11; the French Foreign Ministry said that since January 2025, 292 people from Gaza have been evacuated to the country that borders Belgium. In early June, in an effort to put pressure on Belgian authorities, Alkatari went on a three-week hunger strike protest outside Belgium’s Foreign Ministry in Brussels. Several hundred Palestinian families in Gaza waiting to be evacuated to Belgium are stuck in a similar situation, according to local media reports. In June, a group of lawyers condemned the delay in an open letter published by the Belgian daily La Libre Belgique, addressed to Prime Minister Bart De Wever and Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot. “The Belgian government continues in fact to do everything in its power to prevent men, women and children caught in the hell of Gaza from being able to join their family members in Belgium,” they said.    Belgium rejects the accusations. Belgium has evacuated more than 500 people from Gaza, since the war began, via the Rafah border crossing bordering Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. This group includes Belgian citizens and Palestinians with Belgian refugee status and their lawful partners and children. “These evacuations had to be halted in May 2024, when the Rafah border crossing was closed. It was not until March 2025 that evacuation operations could resume, this time through the border post of Kerem Shalom and Jordan. Since then, around 40 people have been evacuated,” the spokesperson told Al Jazeera. Israelclosedthe Rafah border crossing in May 2024, claiming that it was being used for “terrorist purposes”. In January this year, the crossing wasopenedfor medical evacuations. Belgium organised medical evacuations in July and December last year as part of a pan-European humanitarian mission, in coordination with the World Health Organization. The patients and caretakers were either evacuated from Egypt or directly from Gaza. In October 2024, Belgium’s foreign minister said the rules had changed and only Belgians or their core family members would be eligible for evacuation. But this restriction ended last month, “and preparations began for the resumption of evacuations that had been suspended in May 2024”, the spokesperson added, giving no further details. Asked if Israel is delaying evacuations, the spokesperson said: “A variety of factors continue to cause delays, but efforts are ongoing to find solutions, in close cooperation with all relevant authorities.” Al Jazeera contacted COGAT for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publishing. Bram Frouws, director of the Geneva-based Mixed Migration Centre, told Al Jazeera that European countries could create humanitarian channels, issue laissez-passer or emergency visas, and loosen the documentation requirements. “It’s not impossible, most countries have managed to get Palestinian people that hold dual citizenship of their countries out of Gaza, so with political will, there are possibilities,” he said. “But I don’t think there is much of that political will in the current political climate in most European countries.”"
Bangladesh braces for further unrest after four killed in clashes at rally,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/bangladesh-braces-for-further-unrest-after-four-killed-in-clashes-at-rally,,"Authorities in Bangladesh have imposed heavy security measures to prevent a repeat of further political violence, after clashes between security forces and supporters of deposed Prime MinisterSheikh Hasinaleft four people dead and more than 50 injured. Hundreds of police were deployed Thursday to the site of a planned rally in Faridpur by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political party formed by students who spearheaded theunrestthat ousted longtime leader Hasina last year, local media reported. Their presence underlined the volatile political tensions that remain in the divided country nearly one year on from the mass protests that toppled Hasina from power. On Wednesday, an NCP rally in Gopalganj district, Hasina’s ancestral home and a stronghold for her support base, erupted in violence when supporters of her Awami League party tried to disrupt the event. Four people were killed and more than 50 were injured in the violence, local media reported, citing police. Footage from Gopalganj showed pro-Hasina activists armed with sticks setting upon police and lighting vehicles on fire as NCP leaders arrived in vehicles at the party’s “March to Rebuild the Nation” event commemorating the uprising against Hasina. More than 1,500 police, along with army and border guard personnel, were deployed to respond to the violence, the Dhaka Tribune reported, citing a police report. Armed personnel carriers were seen patrolling the streets as security forces responded to the unrest. The English-language Daily Star, citing Gopalganj civil surgeon Abu Sayeed Md Faruk, named the four dead as Dipto Saha, Ramzan Kazi, Sohel and Emon. The newspaper reported that hospital staff had said that eight others were being operated on for bullet wounds. Home Affairs adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said that 10 police personnel were also injured in the violence, local media reported. He added that 25 people had been arrested over the unrest. The streets of Gopalganj were quiet on Thursday, with shops closed and few vehicles on the road, the Dhaka Tribune reported, as authorities imposed a curfew on the district in response to the violence.    The violence in Gopalganj has underlined the volatile divisions that remain in Bangladesh nearly a year after Hasina was forced to resign, fleeing to exile on a helicopter to India, as the interim government struggles to ensure security. Wednesday’s clashes drew promises of a harsh response from the interim government led byMuhammad Yunusthat has governed the country since Hasina’s ouster last August. Yunus said in a statement Wednesday that the attempt by Hasina’s supporters to disrupt the NCP rally was “a shameful violation of their fundamental rights”, and warned that the violence would “not go unpunished”. The government said on Thursday that it had established a committee to investigate the violence, which would be chaired by Nasimul Ghani, senior secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and report its findings within two weeks. Despite its promises to crack down on those responsible, Yunus’s government has faced criticism for failing to deliver security in the divided country. Hasina’s Awami League party, which authorities banned in May, posted a number of statements on social media platform X condemning the violence, including one saying that all the gunshot victims were supporters of the party. It blamed the interim government for the deaths and injuries. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of two parties, alongside the Awami League, that have traditionally dominated Bangladeshi politics, also criticised the government on Thursday over the violence, saying it had failed to maintain law and order. Meanwhile, the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami party condemned the attacks on the NCP and announced protests of its own. Earlier this month, Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunalindicted Hasinaand two senior officials over alleged crimes against humanity linked to a deadly crackdown on protesters during the uprising against her rule. In a separate, earlier ruling, Hasina – who lives in self-imposed exile in India – was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison for contempt of court by the tribunal."
Trump’s tariff threat to Brazil is a gift to Lula,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/11/trumps-tariff-threat-to-brazil-is-a-gift-to-lula,,"In a provocative move that fuses foreign policy with ideological allegiance, United States President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a50 percent tariffon all Brazilian exports, effective August 1, 2025. The announcement came in a letter posted on social media, in which Trump explicitly linked the proposed tariffs to two ongoing domestic issues in Brazil: the judicial proceedings against far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro – whom Trump described as the victim of a political “witch-hunt” – and recent rulings by the Brazilian Supreme Court against US-based social media companies, including former Trump ally Elon Musk’s X. By doing so, Trump has escalated a trade dispute into a direct attempt to influence Brazil’s internal affairs – using economic pressure to serve political ends and undermining the country’s sovereignty in the process. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva responded swiftly and unequivocally: “Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,” he declared, adding that Brazil’s judiciary is autonomous and not subject to interference or threat. Under Brazilian law, digital platforms are obligated to monitor and remove content that incites violence or undermines democratic institutions, and they may be held legally accountable when they fail to do so. While a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian exports might appear economically devastating, it could in fact become a strategic turning point – and even a blessing in disguise. Brazil has both the resilience and the diplomatic tools to weather this storm and emerge stronger. The United States is one of Brazil’s largest trading partners, typically ranking second after China – or third if the European Union is considered as a single bloc. Brazilian exports to the US include industrial goods such as Embraer aircraft, iron and steel, crude oil, coffee and semiprecious stones, alongside agricultural products like beef, orange juice, eggs and tobacco. In return, Brazil imports large quantities of US-manufactured goods, including machinery, electronics, medical equipment, chemicals and refined petroleum. Notably, the US has maintained a trade surplus with Brazil for the past five years. Should Washington proceed with the 50 percent tariffs, Brasília has several retaliatory options under its Economic Reciprocity Law. These include raising import tariffs on US goods, suspending clauses in bilateral trade agreements, and – in exceptional cases such as this – withholding recognition of US patents or suspending royalty payments to American companies. The impact on US consumers could be immediate and tangible, with breakfast staples like coffee, eggs and orange juice spiking in price. Brazil is not without friends or alternatives. The country has already been deepening ties with fellow BRICS members (China, India, Russia, South Africa) and newer partners in the bloc. This dispute only strengthens the case for accelerating such integration. Diversifying export markets and embracing South-South cooperation isn’t just ideological; it’s economically pragmatic. Closer to home, the tension presents an opportunity to reinvigorate South American integration. The long-held regional dream of enhanced collaboration – from trade to infrastructure – could gain new momentum as Brazil reassesses its global alignments. This realignment could breathe life into stalled Mercosur bloc initiatives and reduce dependence on an increasingly erratic relationship with the US. Ironically, Trump’s aggressive move may weaken his ideological allies in Brazil. While Bolsonaro supporters (including members of his family) have praised the US president’s intervention, they may be missing its broader political consequences. Trump’s past influence abroad has often backfired, with right-wing candidates in countries like Canada and Australia paying the price. A similar outcome in Brazil is not unthinkable. Lula, who has consistently positioned himself as a pragmatic, diplomatic and stabilising global figure, may gain political ground from this latest episode. His defence of sovereignty, democratic institutions and balanced international relations could resonate more deeply with Brazilian voters ahead of next year’s elections. This moment need not be seen as a crisis. Rather, it presents a pivotal opportunity for Brazil to assert itself as a sovereign economic power – less reliant on Washington and more engaged with an emerging multipolar global order. If Lula navigates it wisely, Trump’s latest provocation may deliver not only a diplomatic win but a significant boost to his re-election prospects. In attempting to punish Brazil, Trump may well have undercut both his foreign policy ambitions and his ideological allies abroad.

UK lifts restrictions on Pakistan airlines after five-year ban,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/uk-lifts-restrictions-on-pakistan-airlines-after-five-year-ban,,"Britain has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume flights to and from the United Kingdom as Pakistan steps up efforts to privatise its beleaguered national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). The UK Air Safety Committee decided to lift the ban after aviation safety improvements in Pakistan, the British High Commission in Islamabad said on Wednesday, adding that decisions on delisting states and air carriers were made “through an independent aviation safety process”. “Based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the [UK Air Safety] List,” the high commission said in a statement. The move comes after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted a four-year ban on PIA, and the Pakistani state-owned carrier resumed flights to Europe in January. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the lifting of the ban as “an important milestone for the country”. “The lifting of the ban on Pakistani flights by the UK is a source of relief for Pakistanis residing in Britain,” he added in a statement. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said at a news conference on Wednesday that resuming all routes would improve PIA’s value ahead of its privatisation and there were plans to restart flights to New York. Asif also said he attributed the ban to what he described as “baseless” remarks made by former Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan. He blamed Khan’s false statements and mismanagement during his tenure as aviation minister for the ban. “It was a national-level blunder,” Asif said. PIA was barred from flying to the UK in June 2020, a month after one of its aircraft plunged into a Karachi street, killing 97 people. The disaster was attributed to human error by the pilots and air traffic control and was followed by allegations that nearly a third of the licences for its pilots were fake or dubious. Pakistan launched an investigation to examine these claims. While several private Pakistani airlines operate domestically and on regional routes, primarily to the Middle East, PIA has historically been the only carrier to operate long-haul flights to Britain and the EU. PIA, which employs 7,000 people, has long been accused of being bloated and poorly run – hobbled by unpaid bills, a poor safety record and regulatory issues. PIA had previously estimated an annual revenue loss of about 40 billion rupees ($144m) due to the ban. The airline has long considered UK routes, including London, Manchester and Birmingham, among its most profitable and holds sought-after landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport that could become active again. Pakistan’s government has said it is committed to privatising the debt-ridden airline and has been scrambling to find a buyer. It is hoping that recent reforms that led to the airline’s first operating profit in 21 years, will help attract buyers under a broader International Monetary Fund-backed privatisation push. In 2024, a deal fell through after a potential buyer reportedly offered a fraction of the asking price. This month, Pakistan approved four groups to bid for a 51 to 100 percent stake in PIA. Final bids are expected later this year. PIA was established in 1955 when the government nationalised a loss-making commercial airline. It enjoyed rapid growth until the 1990s."
South Korea to end private adoptions after inquiry finds abuse rife,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/south-korea-to-end-private-adoptions-after-inquiry-finds-abuse-rife,,"South Korea is set to end the decades-old practice of outsourcing adoptions to private agencies, after a damaging investigation concluded the country’s government-endorsed foreign adoption programme violated the fundamental human rights of adoptees. On Saturday, South Korea will introduce a “newly restructured public adoption system, under which the state and local governments take full responsibility for the entire adoption process”, South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare said. South Korea sent more than 140,000 children overseas following the devastating 1950-53 Korean War, when intercountry adoption was encouraged as a solution. ATruth and Reconciliation Commission investigationconcluded earlier this year that the international adoption process had been riddled with irregularities, including “fraudulent orphan registrations, identity tampering, and inadequate vetting of adoptive parents”. The new change is a “significant step towards ensuring the safety and promoting the rights of adopted children”, the Health Ministry added. Under the new system, key procedures – such as assessing prospective adoptive parents and matching them with children – will be deliberated by a ministry committee, under the principle of the “best interests of the child”.    Previously, this had been done by major adoption agencies with minimal oversight from the state. The commission blamed the government for the issues, particularly a failure to regulate adoption fees, which turned the industry into a profit-driven one. “With this restructuring of the public adoption system, the state now takes full responsibility for ensuring the safety and rights of all adopted children,” said Kim Sang-hee, director of population and child policy at the Ministry of Health and Welfare. International adoption began after the Korean War as a way to remove mixed-race children, born to Korean mothers and American soldier fathers, from a country that emphasised ethnic homogeneity. It became big business in the 1970s to 1980s, bringing international adoption agencies millions of dollars as the country overcame post-war poverty and faced rapid and aggressive economic development. Activists say the new measure is only a starting point and warn it is far from sufficient. “While I think it’s high time that Korea close down all private adoption agencies, I don’t believe … having the state handle new adoptions is enough,” said writer Lisa Wool-Rim Sjoblom, a Korean adoptee who grew up in Sweden. The government should prioritise implementing the findings of the truth commission, issue an official apology, and work to help the tens of thousands of Koreans who were sent abroad for adoption, Sjoblom told the AFP news agency. “The government urgently needs to acknowledge all the human rights violations it enabled, encouraged, and systematically participated in, and, as soon as possible, begin reparations.”"
‘Good Trouble Lives On’ protests across US against Trump policies,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/good-trouble-lives-on-protests-across-us-against-trump-policies,,"Demonstrations have taken place at more than 1,600 locations around the United States, in protest against President Donald Trump’scontroversial policiesthat include mass deportations of immigrants and refugees and cuts to medical insurance, as well as the removal of other safety nets for impoverished people. The “Good Trouble Lives On” refrain that underscored the national day of action on Thursday was inspired by the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis, who died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis. He was the youngest and last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists, a group led by Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, a 25-year-old Lewis led some 600 protesters in the Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Lewis was beaten by police, suffering a skull fracture. Organisers had called for peaceful protests to take place on the fifth anniversary of Lewis’s death along streets, at courts and other public spaces in cities including Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles. “We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation’s history,” Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, said during an online news conference on Tuesday. “We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration … as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.” Pushback against Trump so far in his second term has centred on deportations and immigration enforcement tactics, as well as access to healthcare. The administration has pushed third-party countries to accept deportees, and the African country of Eswatini hasconfirmedthis week that it received five individuals deported from the US. The US also completed the deportations of eight men to South Sudan after a judge cleared the way for their transfer to theviolence-hitAfrican country. Trump’s administration has also been actively targeting pro-Palestinian activists.Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student imprisoned for more than three months, this month filed a wrongful detention claim against Trump seeking $20m in damages. The so‑called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” also prompted a backlash for slashing health coverage schemes, Medicare and Medicaid, by $930bn over the next decade. It could leave as many as 17 million Americans without insurance, in one of the steepest rollbacks of social welfare programmes in the US since their inception in 1935. Earlier this month, protesters engaged in a tense standoff as federal authorities conducted mass arrests at two Southern California marijuana farms. One farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic raid. Organisers of the June 14“No Kings”demonstrations said millions of people marched in hundreds of events from New York to San Francisco. Demonstrators branded Trump as a dictator and would-be king for marking his birthday with a military parade."
The South Caucasus is slipping from Russia’s grasp,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/10/the-south-caucasus-is-slipping-from-russias-grasp,,"The recent flare-up between Russia and Azerbaijan is far more than a diplomatic spat: It marks a potential turning point in the balance of power in the South Caucasus. On June 27, Russian special forces conducted a violent raid on ethnic Azerbaijanis in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city in Russia’s Ural region. About 50 people were detained, several were reportedly injured, and two Azerbaijani brothers – Ziyaddin and Huseyn Safarov – died in custody under suspicious circumstances. Autopsies revealed blunt-force trauma and broken ribs, contradicting Russian claims that the men died of heart failure. Survivors reported beatings, electrocution, and degrading treatment. Far from being seen as a routine law enforcement action, the operation has been widely interpreted in Baku as a politically motivated act of intimidation – prompting sharp condemnation from Azerbaijani officials and a wave of anger from the public. On July 1, Azerbaijan’s ambassador to Russia, Rahman Mustafayev, delivered a formal protest to Moscow, denouncing what he described as the unlawful killing and mistreatment of Azerbaijani citizens, including dual nationals. This diplomatic fallout unfolded just as Baku launched its own high-profile crackdown on organised crime – one that notably included the arrest of several Russian nationals, some reportedly linked to Kremlin-funded media outlets and others accused of cyberfraud and drug trafficking. Among those detained were local staff of Sputnik Azerbaijan, the state-run Russian news agency. While the two episodes are officially unrelated, the timing suggests Azerbaijan is signalling a rejection of external coercion and asserting its sovereignty with new intensity. These developments reflect a deeper geopolitical shift. Russia’s traditional levers of influence in the post-Soviet space – military alliances such as the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), energy dependency, and soft power through Russian-language media – are weakening. Strained by the war in Ukraine and international sanctions, the Kremlin has increasingly turned to diaspora policing, symbolic shows of strength, and nationalist rhetoric to maintain control. The Yekaterinburg raid appears to fit this pattern: A demonstration of power aimed at a former Soviet republic now carving out a more independent path. Azerbaijan’s traditionally balanced foreign policy is now entering a more assertive phase. For years, Baku carefully navigated its relations with Russia, the West, and Turkiye. But the events of the past week have marked a clear shift: Azerbaijan is adopting a firmer stance against Kremlin pressure while deepening its strategic alignment with Ankara. This evolving alliance is not only strengthening bilateral ties but fostering broader regional integration through organisations such as the Organization of Turkic States (OTS). The implications extend well beyond Azerbaijan. Moscow’s deteriorating relationship with Baku may trigger a wider realignment across Central Asia. Kazakhstan has already taken steps to distance itself from Russian influence, while Armenia, under Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, has publicly questioned the reliability of Russian security guarantees. Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are simultaneously strengthening ties with Turkiye and China. In this context, Azerbaijan’s defiance signals not an isolated dispute, but a broader erosion of Moscow’s soft power across the former Soviet sphere. For the Kremlin, traditional diplomatic tools are proving increasingly ineffective. In Azerbaijan, public outrage over the deaths in Yekaterinburg is helping shape foreign policy in ways that go beyond formal statecraft. Moscow now faces the real prospect of Baku firmly embedding itself in the Turkish geopolitical orbit – supporting projects such as the Zangezur corridor, and reinforcing a trans-Caspian Turkic axis stretching from Anatolia to Central Asia. This vision stands in stark contrast to the Kremlin’s fading Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) project, which now looks more like a symbolic construct than a meaningful alliance. Meanwhile, the media landscape has become another battleground. Russian state outlets – particularly firebrand figures like Vladimir Solovyov – have adopted openly anti-Azerbaijani rhetoric, stoking ethnic and religious tensions. These attacks blur the line between journalism and state propaganda, further inflaming bilateral tensions and undermining traditional diplomatic protocols. Yet, amid the escalating tensions, Azerbaijan faces a rare strategic opportunity. If managed wisely, Baku can leverage this moment to strengthen its leadership role within the Turkic world and reset its relationship with Russia on more equal terms. In the years ahead, Azerbaijan has the potential to emerge not just as a key energy hub, but as a central geopolitical actor in the South Caucasus and beyond. The Yekaterinburg raid is not simply a matter of domestic policing. It is a symptom of the accelerating breakdown of Moscow’s grip over its “near abroad”. What happens next – whether Russia adapts to the changing dynamics or attempts to reassert control through more coercive means – will shape the next chapter of Eurasian geopolitics. One thing is already clear: The regional balance of power is shifting, and Azerbaijan stands squarely at the centre of that transformation.

Who are the MAGA influencers calling for Pam Bondi’s head over Epstein?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/who-are-the-maga-influencers-calling-for-pam-bondis-head-over-epstein,,"United States President Donald Trump and US Attorney GeneralPam Bondihave come under fire over agovernment reviewof the death of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender,Jeffrey Epstein, in prison. That review found that Epstein died by suicide. Right-wing conspiracy theorists – many of whom form part of Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base – say they believe Epstein was murdered because he had sensitive information about powerful figures, and that this was covered up. They have criticised Bondi for failing to fully publish what are known as the “Epstein files”, including a list of clients they believe exists but which the government review found does not. Some, but not all, of the files compiled by US federal investigators on Epstein wereunsealedin January last year, but many remain redacted. Of particular interest is a theoretical client list. In recent weeks, the furore among MAGA members has been building, much to the fury of Trump. In social media posts on Wednesday, Trump dismissed MAGA conspiracy theorists as “weaklings”, describing the controversy as a “hoax” fabricated by his political opponents.    On July 7, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Department of Justice concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell. On July 14, the same two organisations said there was no evidence Epstein had a specific “secret client list”. However, online amateur investigators have long posed conspiracy theories that the government covered up the truth behind Epstein’s life and death. The July memos breathed new life into the case. When the second memo was released, the Justice Department also released a video of Epstein’s jail cell on the night he died, showing no one entering or exiting. However, the time code jumps by one minute and two seconds just before midnight, further inflaming conspiracy theories that part of the video has been deleted. Pam Bondi has come under intense criticism from many in the MAGA movement since the government’s July 7 and 14 memos detailing its review of the Epstein files. It claimed that no evidence had been found of an Epstein “client list” and that no more files from the investigation would be made public. But Bondi has raised the hopes of conspiracy theorists in the past. During aninterview with Fox Newsin February, when host John Roberts asked the attorney general about government plans to release the list of Epstein’s clients, Bondi said, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump. I’m reviewing that.” Also in February, Bondi presented a tranche of documents titled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” to conservative commentators at the White House. However, it did not contain any revelatory information about Epstein. At the time, she said that she would deliver a “truckload” of evidence, reportedly thousands of pages, about the Epstein case to the FBI, but did not provide details, and none have been forthcoming. The July 7 memo was the last straw for Bondi critics within the MAGA movement, as the “list” she had been promising to release seemingly never existed. On July 8, Bondi denied that, in her February interview, she had been talking about a “client list”. Instead, the “list” she was referring to was the Epstein case file. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said. The same day, Bondi also said that the thousands of videos regarding the Epstein case, reviewed by US intelligence, could not be released as they contained child sex abuse images. “Never going to be released, never going to see the light of day,” she said. Conspiracy theories suggesting a government cover-up of Jeffrey Epstein’s death have persisted in right-wing circles since his death six years ago. Trump ally Kash Patel, appointed FBI director during Trump’s second tenure, and former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, both previously questioned the official suicide ruling. By May this year, however, both said they accepted the government’s conclusion about Epstein’s death. Tech billionaireElon Muskwas once a Trump ally, and he spent almost $300m backing Trump’s presidential campaign alongside other Republicans last year. However, Musk and Trump had a falling out last month over Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”. After that, Musk alleged that Trump himself was named in the Epstein files in a now-deleted post on his X platform. Later on, heexpressed regretfor the social media attack. However, following the July 7 memo, Musk has made more social media posts criticising the Trump administration’s conduct regarding the Epstein files. Early on Thursday, Musk made added a series posts to X in which he sent the platform’s AI chatbotGrokprompts about Epstein such as, “Are there likely to be electronic records in any government or commercial computers recording who traveled on Epstein’s plane to the US Virgin Islands?” and “Please make a thorough list of all those who should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein. Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes.” On July 8, Musk wrote on X, “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?” Musk owns companies such as the carmaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth stood at $361bn as of Friday. Loomer, 32, a Trump ally and far-right conspiracy theorist, wrote on X on July 8, “Pam Blondi [sic] is covering up child sex crimes that took place under HER WATCH when she was Attorney General of Florida,” adding that Bondi “needs to be fired”. In an interview on Wednesday with Politico, Loomer warned that Trump’s handling of the Epstein files threatens to “consume his presidency”. “The best thing that the president can do is appoint a special counsel to handle the Epstein files investigation,” she said. But Loomer made it clear that she still supported Trump and was not splitting from the US president over the issue. “President Trump is doing a lot of great things and we don’t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” she wrote in an X post after her interview. “But we can’t just Truth Social the Epstein Files away. Two things can be true at the same time. I fully support President Trump.” Loomer has long been involved in US politics and backs Trump, but she has not officially worked for his campaign, both Trump and Loomer clarified last year. She unsuccessfully ran for Congress twice in southern Florida as a Republican, in 2020 and 2022. She has a reputation for promoting anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric online. Loomer has clashed with other right-wing figures in the past. Last year, she wrote in an X post that if former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential election, “the White House will smell like curry” as a jab at Harris’s Indian and Jamaicanheritage. She was rebuked for this by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative from Georgia, who wrote in an X post, “This is appalling and extremely racist. It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA. This does not represent President Trump. This type of behavior should not be tolerated ever.” Loomer has been banned from several social media sites. In 2018, she was banned by X, then called Twitter, over her Islamophobic posts. In response, she handcuffed herself to the company’s headquarters in New York. After Musk acquired the social media site in 2022, Loomer’s account was reinstated. An account called “Hodgetwins” posted on X on July 8, “Trump has to fire Pam Bondi. She went on camera and told the world she has the Epstein client list on her desk. Now they say there is no list??” The duo comprises Keith and Kevin Hodge, 50-year-old twin brothers who post content online about fitness and politics. The twins have a channel on YouTube with 3.4 million subscribers. The first published video on their channel is dated September 2010. The pair posted videos about fitness and bodybuilding until they pivoted to food content around 2016 and then to relationship advice in 2021. In recent years, they have posted about culture and politics. The twins have a website through which they sell dietary supplements and merchandise, including T-shirts that say “America Only” and snapback caps that say “Gulf of America“. One shirt says “Alligator Alcatraz“, with an illustration of an alligator clad in a military green uniform with a cigar in its mouth. Alligator Alcatraz is the moniker assigned to amigrant detention facilityin Florida. They also have a podcast called TwinsPod, for which they started releasing episodes last year. On July 11, they posted a podcast episode more than two hours long titled, Epstein List COVERUP?! This Is Getting Weird… The guest in this episode was Harrison Smith, a host at conspiracy theory website Infowars. On July 8, conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder Alex Jones posted on X, “Next the DOJ will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed’,” calling the memo’s findings “over the top sickening”. Jones, 51, has advocated multiple conspiracy theories over the years, including that the US government failed to prevent, or was involved in, the Oklahoma City bombing and the 9/11 attacks. The Oklahoma bombing was a domestic terrorist attack which happened on April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma. A truck bomb exploded outside the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring more than 600 other people. Jones spent the past three years in federal bankruptcy court after beingordered to pay$1.3bn to families of the 2012Sandy Hook school shootingvictims in defamation suits in Connecticut and Texas for falsely claiming the shooting was a hoax. He grew up in Dallas and moved to Austin with his family as a teenager. In 1996, he began working for a radio station in Austin, but was fired three years later because his opinions made it difficult to get sponsors on the show, according to the local publication, the Austin Chronicle. After he was fired, Jones set up the Infowars website, buying the domain name for $9. He broadcast from his house.    Far-right influencer Jack Posobiec posted on X on July 7, “We were all told more was coming. That answers were out there and would be provided. Incredible how utterly mismanaged this Epstein mess has been. And it didn’t have to be.” Posobiec has been sharing conspiracy theories about the Epstein case for years. In 2022, the FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to recover possible classified documents. Soon after, Posobiec claimed the judge who approved the raid was “Epstein’s lawyer”. This was misleading because while Judge Bruce Reinhart had represented Epstein’s employees in the past, he was simply the available magistrate at the time, according to local reports. Posobiec also has a reputation for posting anti-Semitic and white supremacist content online. In February this year, The Washington Post reported that Posobiec had been invited on Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s first overseas trip to Europe. The far-right figure is best known for promoting “Pizzagate“, a conspiracy theory alleging that Democratic politicians were involved in a pedophilia ring. The theory picked up during the 2016 presidential election when Pizzagate theorists alleged that then-presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a pizza place.    Experts say that, while critics within MAGA may well be trying to make Bondi the scapegoat in this situation, she still has Trump’s backing. “Hardcore MAGA figures would undoubtedly like to make Pam Bondi into a scapegoat, but at the moment, she still seems to have Trump’s support. It’s more likely that Trump will push the blame elsewhere,” Peter Knight, a professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, told Al Jazeera. Knight added that Trump could instead blame groups, including “the Democrats, the Deep State, the Fake News media”. Trump has already blamed news outlets and Democrats for promoting the “Epstein hoax”. The Deep State refers to the idea that there is a hidden group of powerful people, often in government, intelligence, or military agencies, who secretly control or influence government policy, no matter which leaders are publicly in charge. Despite promising to release all the Epstein files during his presidential campaign last year, Trump is now showingangertowards his supporters over Epstein conspiracy theories. “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘b*******,’ hook, line, and sinker,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. “I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,” Trump wrote. “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!” he continued. On Tuesday, TrumpsaidBondi had handled the situation “very well”, adding, “whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.” On July 12, Trump posted on Truth Social: “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’ They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening.” During a White House Cabinet meeting on July 8, a reporter asked Bondi about the missing minute on the Epstein prison video, which was circulated the day before. Trump, who also attended the meeting, jumped in,asking, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy’s been talked about for years”. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable,” Trump added before asking Bondi if she wanted to “waste time” answering the question. When asked by a journalist if the attorney general had told Trump whether his name appeared in any of the records, he said, “No, no.” The president also questioned the enduring fascination with the Epstein case, “only really bad people, including the fake news, want to keep something like this going.” “In theory, this event could turn the MAGA faithful against Trump,” Knight said. “But it is very unlikely that the MAGA crowd will turn against Trump because of the Epstein files, even if they have good reason to feel betrayed. There is no one else that they could get behind in the same way as Trump. Instead, it’s much more likely that this episode will soon be drowned out by the next conspiracy theory media spectacle.”"

"Can Donald Trump fire Jerome Powell, US Federal Reserve chair?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/can-donald-trump-fire-jerome-powell-us-federal-reserve-chair,,"President Donald Trump is sending mixed messages about whether he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trumpsaidon July 16 he is “not planning on doing anything” when asked if he would fire Powell. However, he also said he doesn’t “rule out anything” and mentioned a renovation project with ballooning costs. “I think it’s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud,” Trump said. “And it’s possible there’s fraud involved with the $2.5, $2.7 billion renovation. This is a renovation, how do you spend $2.7 billion? And he didn’t have proper clearance.” The Federal Reserve has been undergoing building renovations since 2021 on a project that the board that controls the Fed first approved in 2017. The project’s cost of $2.5bn is about $600m above the original budget, according to The Associated Press. The cost has increased because of design changes, increasing labour and material costs and “unforeseen conditions”, such as “more asbestos than anticipated”, the Fed said in an FAQ. But Trump’s administration seems to be using the renovation as a possible reason to oust Powell. Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, sent Powell a July 10 letter saying the project is “out of compliance with the approved plan” and “in violation of” the National Capital Planning Act, which outlines how agencies can make changes to federal buildings.    Trump’s feud with Powell isn’t new. For months, the president hascriticisedPowell, whom he appointed to the role in 2017, forrefusing to drop interest rates. The Fed raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 during former President Joe Biden’s administration as a response to inflation. Since Trump entered the White House in January, he has told Powell toresignand threatened to fire him. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump said in April. “I’m not happy with him.” In November, after the 2024 election, reporters askedPowellif he would step down or whether he thought Trump had the authority to fire him. “Not permitted under the law,” Powell said. Trump spoke to a group of Republican lawmakers on July 15 about firing the chair, several news organisations reported. Trump showed lawmakers a draft letter firing Powell, The New York Times reported. Trump denied having written a letter. “No, I talked about the concept of firing him. I said, ‘What do you think?’ Almost every one of them said I should,” Trump said. “But I’m more conservative than they are.” While Trump attributed his reticence to fire Powell to his “conservatism”, the bigger impediment is a question of legality. Here’s why. The Federal Reserve is the country’s central bank. Its responsibilities include setting interest rates and supervising and regulating banks. It was created in 1913 as part of the Federal Reserve Act and is run by an independent board of governors. The seven governors that make up the board are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The president selects the chair and two vice chairs from among the seven, according to the Congressional Research Service. While talking to reporters, Trump appeared to overlook that he was the person who nominated Powell to be the chair in 2017: “I’m surprised he was appointed,” Trump said. “I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him.” In 2021, Bidennominatedhim for a second four-year term, which is set to end in May 2026. After that, Powell can remain on the board of governors until January 2028.    Unlike other government agencies, the Fed has a lot of independence from Congress and the White House, the Congressional Research Service said in a January report. According to the report, economists have justified the independence, saying that decisions about monetary policy shouldn’t be influenced by political pressures. To ensure Fed accountability, the chair testifies before Congress, much like other government agencies. The Fed chair can be removed “for cause by the President”, according to the law. This refers to “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office”, according to a Supreme Court decision about the Federal Trade Commission. In May, the Supreme Court ruled on Trump’s authority to fire members of two different independent agencies. In its 6-3 ruling, the Court granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to fire the heads of the agencies while the case over the legality of firing them played out in the courts. In its opinion, the Supreme Court addressed the Fed, saying its ruling didn’t affect the agency. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” the Supreme Court said. Some legal experts question the legality of Trump firing Powell. Any move to oust him would likely end up in the courts. Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Fed’s building renovation costs aren’t “cause” for Powell’s dismissal. “There is no factual basis to support any conclusion that the cost overruns on the renovation project constitute anything like fraud or gross negligence,” Conti-Brown said. “Had Powell committed fraud, in this context or any other, there could well be a case for his removal.” Conti-Brown said that Trump has long talked about wanting Powell’s removal. A court may consider Trump citing the renovation’s budget as “pretext” for his firing – a legal term used to describe a false reason an employer gives for firing an employee in order to cover the real reason, Conti-Brown said. “Courts evaluating any attempted removal after the fact will assess both the animus and pretext very heavily against President Trump,” Conti-Brown said. However, it is unclear how courts would react because “this is uncharted legal territory”, Jeremy Kress, a former Fed banking regulator who is a faculty director of the University of Michigan’s Center on Finance, Law and Policy, told The New York Times. Lev Menand, a legal scholar at Columbia University, agreed with Kress. “In normal times, I would say Powell wins 10 times out of 10,” Menand told The New York Times. “But these aren’t normal times, because this court has shown that it is willing to look the other way when the president engages in illegal conduct and it is willing to construe the president’s power under the Constitution as so broad as to allow the president to flout laws.”"
An open letter from the presidents of Gaza universities,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/14/an-open-letter-from-the-presidents-of-gaza-universities,,"We, the presidents of Gaza’s three non-profit universities— Al-Aqsa University, Al-Azhar University-Gaza, and the Islamic University of Gaza — together accounting for the vast majority of Gaza’s students and faculty members, issue this unified statement to the international academic community at a time of unprecedented devastation of higher education in Gaza. Israel’s ongoing genocidal war has brought about scholasticide—a systematic and deliberate attempt to eliminate our universities, their infrastructure, faculty, and students. This destruction is not collateral; it is part of a targeted effort to eradicate the foundations of higher education in Gaza—foundations that have long stood as pillars of resilience, hope, and intellectual freedom under conditions of occupation and siege. While academic institutions across Palestine have faced attacks for decades, what we are witnessing today is an escalation: a shift from repeated acts of destruction to an attempt at total annihilation. Yet, we remain resolute. For more than a year, we have mobilised and taken steps to resist this assault and ensure that our universities endure. Despite the physical obliteration of campuses, laboratories, libraries, and other facilities, and the assassination of our students and colleagues, our universities continue to exist. We are more than buildings — we are academic communities, comprised of students, faculty, and staff, still alive and determined to carry forward our mission. As articulated in the Unified EmergencyStatementfrom Palestinian Academics and Administrators issued on May 29, 2024, “Israeli occupation forces have demolished our buildings, but our universities live on.” For over a year, our faculty, staff and students have persisted in our core mission — teaching — under unimaginably harsh conditions. Constant bombardment, starvation, restrictions on internet access, unstable electricity, and the ongoing horrors of genocide have not broken our will. We are still here, still teaching, and still committed to the future of education in Gaza. We urgently call on our colleagues around the world to work for: We appeal to the international academic community — our colleagues, institutions, and friends — to: Last year, we formally established the Emergency Committee of Universities in Gaza, representing our three institutions and affiliated colleges — together enrolling between 80 and 85 percent of Gaza universities’ students. The committee exists to resist the erasure of our universities and offer a unified voice for Gaza’s academic community. It has since established subject-focused subcommittees to serve as trusted and coordinated channels for support. We call upon academic communities around the world to coordinate themselves in response to this call. The time for symbolic solidarity has passed. We now ask for practical, structured, and enduring partnership. Work alongside us to ensure that Gaza’s universities live on and remain a vital part of our collective future.

‘Lives controlled by crime’: Explosive allegations hit South Africa police,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/15/lives-controlled-by-crime-explosive-allegations-hit-south-africa-police,,"Cape Town, South Africa –When Patricia Blows heard a senior police official’s explosive allegations against South Africa’s political and law enforcement elite last week, her thoughts went straight to the stalled investigation into her son’s killing nine years ago. Angelo, an apprentice boilermaker, was about to turn 28 when he was shot in an apparent robbery on a Sunday afternoon in March 2016 while walking home from work in Langlaagte, Johannesburg. To this day, the investigation has gone nowhere despite Blows providing the police with evidence they said they lacked, including witness statements she collected herself. The lack of progress in the case began to make sense last week when the police commissioner in coastal KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, claimed he haduncovereda crime syndicate involving politicians, senior police officers, correctional services officials, prosecutors, the judiciary and businesspeople in his province. According to Mkhwanazi, speaking at a news conference on July 6, the systemic corruption rises all the way to the country’s police minister, Senzo Mchunu, whom he accused of disbanding a task force set up to investigate political killings in KZN to protect his shady associates. Like millions of South Africans, Blows was outraged by Mkhwanazi’s allegations – but not entirely surprised. “I immediately thought of our battle for justice. I just couldn’t find an open door. It still hurts like hell,” said Blows, a community activist from Blackheath on theCape Flats, a part of Cape Town plagued by violent drug-trafficking gangs. “I had fresh hope in Mchunu. Now this? Then doubt drifted in, and I had an overwhelming fear for [Mkhwanazi’s] safety,” Blows said from her suburb on the outskirts of the Cape Flats, where a police station came under attack about a month ago, presumably in retaliation for the arrest of a local crime boss.    Mkhwanazi’s revelations triggered an outpouring of support from crime-weary South Africans and politicians alike, who almost universally admire his no-nonsense approach to crime. Last month, after a series of police shootouts with criminals, he was quoted as saying he cared more about impact than strategy. His popularity reflects a national malaise as well as a regional one that is particular to volatile KZN. The province regularly features among the country’s crime hotspots and is notorious for its history of political violence that dates back to the 1980s when the apartheid regime fomented tensions among the Black supporters of the African National Congress (ANC) and its rival Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in an attempt to undermine the planned transition to democracy. National quarterly statistics for January to March indicated a decrease in violent crime compared with the same quarter in 2024. Murders decreased by 12.4 percent to 5,727, or an average of 64 per day, according to theInstitute for Security Studies. Still, violent crime is a major problem. According to the World Population Review, South Africa has the fifth highest crime index in the world, following Venezuela, Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan and Haiti. South Africa also ranks 82nd in the world on the corruption perception index compiled by the NGO Transparency International. In this context, Mkhwanazi has become a hero to many South Africans who are fed up with the government’s failure to address chronic social ills. Not even an investigation into his conduct in March could dampen the support for Mkhwanazi. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate dropped the case after a “Hands off Mkhwanazi” campaign, which was revived on social media after his July 6 news conference. Dressed in special operations fatigues and surrounded by armed guards, Mkhwanazi told journalists: “I am combat ready. I will die for this badge. I will not back down.” Much to the frustration of many South Africans, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s response to the unfolding crisis has been in sharp contrast to Mkhwanazi’s gung-ho attitude. In a brief and carefully crafted televised address on Sunday, Ramaphosa announced thatMchunuhad been placed on special leave and he would establish a judicial commission of inquiry to look into the allegations raised by Mkhwanazi. Kagiso Pooe, a senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand’s School of Governance in Johannesburg, was hoping for Mchunu to be suspended or fired and the country’s seemingly compromised security structure to be overhauled, especially after the recent arrest of a senior crime intelligence official and several officers for fraud. Pooe believes Ramaphosa played it safe to preserve himself and his ANC party, which was forced to form a coalition government with rivals after it failed to secure an outright majority in last year’s general election. It was a historic defeat for Nelson Mandela’s party, which has dominated domestic politics since the democratic era began in 1994. Before local government elections next year, Pooe believes the last thing Ramaphosa wants is to alienate an ally like Mchunu, who has a strong support base in the highly contested KZN and helped secure Ramaphosa’s presidency in 2017. “He doesn’t rock the boat. It’s not in his nature,” Pooe said, pointing out that Ramaphosa is determined to accomplish what no president has managed to do since 1994 – complete a second term in office. “I give the president 33 percent, which is the average score for everything he does,” he said.    Pooe bemoaned the idea of yet another commission of inquiry under Ramaphosa. In May, the president even appointed acommissionto investigate the by-product of a previous commission set up in 1996 that failed to deal with apartheid-era crimes. Decades on, more than 100 cases that arose from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have yet to be prosecuted. The most high-profile commission under Ramaphosa was established shortly after he took office in 2017. The Zondo Commission was meant to investigate corruption that was so deeply entrenched under Ramaphosa’s predecessorJacob Zumathat it became known as “state capture”. After millions of dollars and years of highly publicised testimony, the findings of the commission have yet to deliver a major prosecution. Toyin Adetiba, a professor at the University of Zululand’s Department of Political and International Studies, said Ramaphosa could pay a dear price for failing to act decisively, especially at a time when he is trying to burnish South Africa’s international reputation and fend off the threat of potentially damaging tariffs from the United States. “Remember, he will soon be out as the president of the country and that of the ANC. The respect that he commands among political leaders across the continent will suffer a setback, and for him to play the role of elder statesperson after leaving office will be a Herculean task as no one will respect his opinion, no matter how important and genuine it might be,” Adetiba said. In a strange twist of timing, this crisis comes as the country marks the anniversary of theJuly 2021 unrestwhen riots broke out in two of the country’s most populous provinces – KZN and Gauteng – after Zuma’s imprisonment for contempt of court following his refusal to testify before the Zondo Commission. The leader of the minority party Freedom Front Plus, Pieter Groenewald, blamed the unrest on a failure of the intelligence services. Pooe said Mkhwanazi’s allegations supported the view that the country’s intelligence has been compromised. “South Africa is literally naked intelligence-wise. Think about it from the perspective of foreign entities and criminals,” Pooe said. “If this [the allegations of corruption] is happening, don’t you think criminals also know that you can take advantage of a country like South Africa?” As the country processes Ramaphosa’s much-awaitedspeechin response to Mkhwanazi’s allegations and wonders what is to come, Blows is recovering from the shock of another shooting in her neighbourhood, reported on a community WhatsApp group. This time, it sounded like an automatic weapon was used. “I seriously pray daily against the high crime. Many parents suffer as I do,” Blows said. “Our lives are controlled by crime.”"
"‘Just a few bones’: 30 years on, Srebrenica still buries its dead",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/11/just-a-few-bones-thirty-years-on-srebrenica-still-buries-its-dead,,"Potocari, Bosnia and Herzegovina –In a grassy valley dotted with white gravestones, thousands of people gathered to mark 30 years since the Srebrenica genocide on Friday. Seven victims of the1995 genocide, some of whose remains were only discovered and exhumed in the past year from mass graves uncovered in Liplje, Baljkovica, Suljici and Kamenicko Brdo, were buried during the sombre anniversary on Friday. Limited remains of one of the victims, Hasib Omerovic, who was 34 when he was killed, were found and exhumed from a mass grave in 1998, but his family delayed his burial until now, hoping to recover more. Zejad Avdic, 46, is the brother of another of the victims being buried. Senajid Avdic was just 19 when he was killed on July 11, 1995. His remains were discovered in October 2010 at a site in Suljici, one of the villages attacked that day by Bosnian Serb forces. “When the news came, at first, I couldn’t – I didn’t – dare tell my mother, my father. It was too hard,” Avdic told Al Jazeera, referring to the moment he learned that some of his brother’s remains had been found. “What was found wasn’t complete, just a few bones from the skull.” Families like Avdic’s have waited decades for even a fragment of bone to confirm their loved one’s death. Many have buried their loved ones with only partial remains. The Srebrenica genocide was the crescendo of Bosnia’s three-year war from 1992 to 1995, which flared up in the aftermath ofYugoslavia’s dissolution, pitting Bosnian Serbs against the country’s two other main ethnic populations – Croats and Muslim Bosniaks.    On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces stormed the enclave of Srebrenica, ​​a designated United Nations-protected safe zone, overrunning the Dutch UN battalion stationed there. They separated at least 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters, slaughtering them en masse. Thousands of men and boys attempted to escape through the surrounding woods, but Serb forces chased them through the mountainous terrain, killing and capturing as many as they could. Women and children were expelled from the city and neighbouring villages by bus. Thousands of people attended the commemoration for victims of the genocide on Friday, which began with a congregational Islamic prayer – men, women and children prostrating in unison among the rows of gravestones. After the prayer, the remains of the victims, who have been identified using extensive DNA analysis, were carried in green coffins draped with the Bosnian flag. The coffins were lowered into newly prepared graves. At each site, groups of men stepped forward to take turns covering the caskets with soil, shovelling from nearby mounds in a solemn conclusion to the proceedings. After the remains had been buried, the victims’ families crowded around the sites, wiping away their tears as an imam recited verses over the caskets. Fikrera Tuhljakovic, 66, attends the memorial here each year, but this year her cousin was among the victims being buried. She said she is determined to ensure he is remembered and that all of the victims are never forgotten. “I will keep coming as long as I’m alive,” Tuhljakovic told Al Jazeera. Forensic scientists and the International Commission on Missing Persons have, in the decades since the mass killings, worked to locate the remains of those killed. More than 6,000 victims have been buried at the memorial site in Potocari, but more than 1,000remain missing. In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) declared the events in Srebrenica and the surrounding area a genocide. Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were both convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison. In total, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced almost 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the genocide. But many accusedremain unpunished. Denial of the genocide also continues – especially among political leaders in Serbia and the Serb-majority entity of Republika Srpska, which was established in the northeast of the country at the start of the war in 1992 with the stated aim of protecting the interests of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Emir Cica, Islamic Relief’s Bosnia country director, international institutions have not done enough to prevent atrocities like Srebrenica from happening again, with similar happening in Gaza at the moment. “When we see what has happened, for example, in Gaza, it is very painful for us because we understand this [experience],” Cica told Al Jazeera. For Avdic, Gaza is indeed a painful reminder of history repeating itself. “Today we are burying our victims of genocide, and today in Gaza, genocide is happening, too,” he said solemnly. “I don’t know what kind of message to send; there’s no effect on those in power who could actually do something.” Reporting for this trip was made possible by the NGO Islamic Relief."
Ukraine appoints new prime minister in major government reshuffle,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/ukraine-appoints-new-prime-minister-in-major-government-reshuffle,,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed a new prime minister and other key leaders in the largest government reshuffle since Russia invaded three years ago. Yulia Svyrydenko, 39, took over as prime minister from Denys Shmyhal, who had held the post since 2020, following her confirmation on Thursday by Ukraine’s parliament. Svyrydenko previously served as first deputy prime minister and minister of economic development and trade, roles that brought her in close contact with the administration of United States President Donald Trump. She was credited with negotiating a critical mineral deal between Washington and Kyiv earlier this year that helped thaw an initially frosty relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy. Svyrydenko said on social media that she intends to focus on expanding Ukraine’s domestic weapons production and the strength of its armed forces, and supporting the economy. “Our Government sets its course toward a Ukraine that stands firm on its own foundations — military, economic, and social,” she said. “My key goal is real, positive results that every Ukrainian will feel in daily life. War leaves no room for delay. We must act swiftly and decisively,” she said.   Outgoing Prime Minister Shmyhal, 49, will step in as defence minister, taking over a ministry that has struggled with a series of corruption scandals. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, 50, will stay in place, but Zelenskyy has named outgoing Justice Minister Olga Stefanishyna, 39, as his next ambassador to the US, pending US approval. Stefanishyna has experience working with the European Union and NATO and also played a role in negotiating the recent mineral deal with the Trump administration. Stefanishyna will replace outgoing envoy Oksana Markarova, who earned the ire of Trump due to her positive working relationship with the administration of former US President Joe Biden. Reports last week indicated that Zelenskyy was planning to choose Defence Minister Rustem Umerov as his next US envoy, but he was allegedly not approved by Washington, according to opposition MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak. Other reshuffles will see deputies Oleksiy Sobolev and Taras Kachka take over as the minister of economy, environment and agriculture and deputy prime minister for European integration. Despite the shake-up in positions, critics say the new faces in Zelenskyy’s cabinet remain largely the same. They have also accused the Ukrainian leader of consolidating power by stacking key government posts with his “loyalists”."
Report: LeBron James expected to remain with Lakers this season,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/16/lebron-james-staying-with-lakers-despite-trade-rumours-report,,"Despite an off season of rumours and speculation, LeBron James is expected to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2025-26 basketball season, The Athletic has reported. The Lakers and James have not engaged in talks about a trade or buyout, and the NBA’s all-time leading scorer is expected to report to camp with the Lakers this autumn, per the report published on Wednesday. There haven’t been any signs, either, that James wants out. James picked up his $52.6m option last month to return for an eighth season with the Lakers. He will be returning to a team this time around on which, for the first time in his career, he is the second option. Luka Doncic, acquired in a stunning trade from the Dallas Mavericks in February, is expected to be the centrepiece for Los Angeles in the upcoming season. Apparently fuelling the trade or buyout rumours is a statement made by James’s longtime agent, Rich Paul, last month that included this line, “We do want to evaluate what’s best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.” Trading James, given his salary, would be difficult since NBA trades must be for players with contracts of similar value due to the salary cap. The Lakers, according to The Athletic, also are reluctant to take on a player earning in the $50m range if he has additional years on the contract. The Lakers will be free of James’s $52.6m player option once his contract expires at the end of the upcoming season. James, 40, is entering his record-setting 23rd NBA season. He has played in 1,562 regular-season games and is 50 shy of breaking Hall of Fame member Robert Parish’s NBA record. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games in 2024-25 to rank in the top 22 in each category. The Lakers forward also finished sixth in most valuable player (MVP) voting. He is a 21-time All-Star, four-time league MVP and four-time NBA champion. He has scored a record 42,184 regular-season points, and 50,473 in the regular season and playoffs combined. James entered the NBA as an 18-year-old after being selected number one in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He turns 41 in December."

"Felix Baumgartner, extreme athlete, dies in paragliding crash in Italy",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/felix-baumgartner-extreme-athlete-dies-in-paragliding-crash-in-italy,,"Renowned extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner, most famous for jumping from a record 39 kilometres (24 miles) at the edge of space in the 2012 Red Bull Stratos project, has died in a paragliding accident in Italy on Thursday. The 56-year-old Austrian crashed his paraglider in Porto Sant’Elpidio, situated on the Italian Adriatic coast, after losing control and plunged into a wooden structure next to a swimming pool of the Le Mimose Family Camping Village, according to Italian media reports. A female hotel employee was injured by a piece of debris and taken to hospital with neck injuries. Baumgartner died at the scene of the accident, and investigations into the circumstances of the accident are under way. Italian media reported that Baumgartner had already lost consciousness in the air. The city’s mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, confirmed Baumgartner’s death in a social media post. “Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,” the mayor said. Just two hours before his deadly crash, heposted on the social media platform Instagramwith the foreboding caption “too much wind”. Born in Salzburg, Baumgartner completed his first parachute jump at the age of 16 and later became a parachutist in the Austrian military. Baumgartner’s reputation as an extreme sports athlete grew exponentially when he turned his hand to the sport of base jumping in the 1990s. He set a new world record for the highest base jump from a building with his leap from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1999. Later that year, he completed a base jump from the famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On July 31, 2003, Baumgartner again made global headlines for his base jumping feats when he became the first person to cross the English Channel in free fall after jumping out of a plane equipped with specially developed wings made of carbon. But it was Baumgartner’s record-breaking free fall from space in 2012 that shot the Austrian to worldwide fame. Over the desert of New Mexico, he jumped from a helium balloon almost 39km (24 miles) above the planet and became the first person to break the sound barrier in free fall. Baumgartner set three world records for his jump: He reached a maximum speed of 1,357.6 kilometres per hour (834mph), or Mach 1.25; completed the highest jump at 38,969 metres; and recorded the longest free fall with a length of 36,402 metres. His death was confirmed late on Thursday by the energy drink company Red Bull, which sponsored many of Baumgartner’s stunts."
"The superhero film genre is on a decline, and so is American empire",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/14/the-superhero-film-genre-is-on-a-decline-and-so-is-american-empire,,"Last week, Warner Bros Pictures released a new reboot of the Superman film series. The movie soared to the top of the box office and grossed an estimated $122m in the United States in its opening weekend. Though the industry is celebrating the film’s early box office totals, they are well below the earnings of comparable blockbusters from a decade ago. For example, in its opening weekend in 2016, Warner Bros’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice reaped a healthy $166m ($224m when adjusted for inflation). Indeed, over the past few years, revenues from such films have steadily fallen, and the new Superman film is not an exception. In the 2010s, superhero movies regularly reaped more than $500m worldwide in box office totals. In recent years, far fewer have reached that high watermark – a fact that is causing unease in the industry. Last year, Hollywood trade magazine Variety warned that the genre was experiencing an “unprecedented box office drought”. What made superhero movies fall off? According to Hollywood bigwigs, the reason is “superhero fatigue”, as Superman director James Gunn put it. Disney CEO Bob Iger opined that the prolific output of superhero movies “diluted [the audience’s] focus and attention”. But their narrative — that consumers are simply getting “fatigued” with the genre — is reductive. As with all artistic genres, there are reasons why some rise or fall in popularity. Those reasons are intimately tied to politics. Superhero fiction is a uniquely US genre, arguably invented in 1938 with the publication of the first Superman comic book. The first superhero comic adaptation was released in 1941 under the title Adventures of Captain Marvel. The genre was popular among Americans for decades, but it really took off following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Those attacks punctured the relative tranquillity (in the US, at least) of the post-Cold War era and put the US propaganda machine into overdrive. Americans were fed a cartoonish portrait of what a “supervillain” looked like, which fit easily into superhero movie narratives. These supervillains were — like America’s purported enemies — bent on global domination and opposed to liberalism and US hegemony. The Pentagon played a prominent role in shaping propagandistic narratives in popular culture. As a longtime partner of Hollywood, the Department of Defense has long had the practice of loaning out military equipment to filmmakers in exchange for script approval rights. In the post-9/11 era, it had a say in the scripts of a number of superhero blockbusters, including Iron Man and Captain America. Captain Marvel was even used as a recruitment tool for pilots by the US air force. As a result, many superhero movies depict the US military and superheroes working hand-in-hand to defeat supervillainy, jointly pushing a vision of Pax Americana: a world where the dominant global power is the US. The protagonists are often portrayed as defenders of “American ideals” like democracy, inclusivity, and justice. Take someone like Captain America, who originated as a literal embodiment of the US cultural victory over fascism. Other popular superheroes of the past 20 years, like Black Panther, embodied liberal America’s multicultural, pluralistic ideals. But in recent years, the political reality those heroes are meant to uphold has begun to fracture. A September 2024 poll asked Americans whether they agreed with the statement “my country’s leader should have total, unchecked authority”. An astonishing 57.4 percent of US respondents agreed. Another poll conducted a year earlier found that 45 percent of Americans “point to people seeing racial discrimination where it really doesn’t exist as the larger issue”. It increasingly seems that America as a liberal, pluralistic society — the way it is depicted in superhero films — is no longer a universal aspiration for many Americans. There is also growing scepticism towards America’s moral authority and superpower standing in the world. A 2024 poll from Fox News found that 62 percent of American voters described the US as “on the decline”. Only 26 percent thought it was rising. A 2023 poll from Pew Research — a year before Donald Trump was re-elected — reported that 58 percent of those polled said that “life in America is worse today than it was 50 years ago”. While public perceptions gradually changed in the post-9/11 period, there were events that accelerated this shift. The precipitous drop in superhero movie box office totals began in 2020. Why that year? This was when the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already growing societal divisions. The sense of a cohesive national identity fully shattered with the onset of this unprecedented public health emergency. Widespread mistrust of the government’s ability to manage the crisis — coupled with a deeply individualistic streak in Americans that precluded any understanding of social obligations that would prevent mass death, such as social distancing or lockdown measures — fostered a furious and splintered American body politic. The singular vision of liberal American righteousness suggested by superhero films could not resonate amid this factional political landscape. A year later came the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The decision to pull out upset the notion of the US as a “heroic” intervener — a sort of global superman – heavily projected after 9/11. In contrast to Iraq, Afghanistan was long presented as a potential “success story”, or as The New York Times put it in 2005: the “American-led intervention that could wind up actually making people’s lives better”. Of course, we all know how that turned out: the US entered Afghanistan in 2001 and exited in 2021, having killed more than 100,000 people and spent $2.3 trillion to pause Taliban rule for 20 years. With its military power failing abroad and tensions rising at home, the US did not seem like a place that anyone — superhero or mortal — believed in any more. Inevitably, the domestic ills ignored by the political elites came to the fore. Real wages had been in decline for 30 years, while income inequality had been increasing, and infrastructure – decaying. Americans on both left and right began to question the fitness of the US political system, long portrayed as the best in the world. Many on the left now believe that corporate interests have so thoroughly captured the Democratic Party that they have ceased fighting for real wealth redistribution or social programmes, and conspire against progressive candidates who do believe in these things. Meanwhile, the American right has grown more venal, racist and authoritarian — the result of failing to understand the true reasons behind the country’s socioeconomic crises. In depicting America as, ultimately, a force for good, the superhero movie genre does not speak to either of these political lines. Hollywood elites do not seem to understand this, however. Gunn, who directed the new Superman movie, described the feature as a metaphor for American values. “Superman is the story of America,” Gunn said in an interview with The Times of London. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.” His words spurred a furious reaction from the American right. “We don’t go to the movie theatre to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us,” Kellyanne Conway, former senior counsellor to President Trump, said on Fox News. The recent American tendency to hyper-politicise film and slot all movies into either “woke” or “anti-woke” categories does not bode well for these kinds of tentpole blockbusters that, in days of yore, would attract audiences of all political stripes. Superhero movies are an optimistic as well as a nationalistic genre — their primary message is that America, and the liberal order in general, are worth defending. But Americans no longer seem optimistic about the future, nor particularly attached to these ideological values. Fewer Americans seem to even believe in liberal pillars like democracy and multiculturalism — the kinds of things that superheroes typically fight for. If we cannot seem to agree on what American values even are, it is understandable that we cannot agree on what kind of hero would embody the national spirit. Given these dispiriting political conditions, perhaps it is not super-surprising that Americans are not flocking to the superhero genre like they once did.

Myanmar military claims recapture of strategic town from rebel force,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/myanmar-military-claims-recapture-of-strategic-town-from-rebel-force,,"Myanmar’s military government has claimed to have removed rebel fighters and recaptured a town after a yearlong battle near the country’s main army training academy, marking a rare turnaround for the regime in the northeast region of the country. The country’s ruling military announced on Thursday that it made the advance in Shan State’s town of Nawnghkio, which had been under the control of the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). The rebel group, part of theThree Brotherhood Alliance, had seized the strategically important town, which sits on a key highway linking central Myanmar to China, in July 2024. In a statement published in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar, the military government said it had retaken Nawnghkio after “566 armed engagements within 11 operational months”. A rare one-page spread in the newspaper showed soldiers holding rifles aloft in celebration. It detailed the battle, admitting initial attacks led to officers and enlisted men “sacrificing their lives”. But “by combining strategic ground and air military tactics”, the military captured “the whole Nawnghkio area” by Wednesday, it said. Nawnghkio is located about 40km (25 miles) from Pyin Oo Lwin, the town that hosts the country’s main military officer training academy, and some 80km (50 miles) from Myanmar’s second-most populous city, Mandalay.    In a statement, the TNLA did not acknowledge the military government’s claim of victory, saying only that “it has been difficult to continue administrative work in the town due to the heavy offensive”. The TNLA added that it had “moved civil administration services to safe locations”. While the combined rebel offensive against government forces has inflicted sweeping losses since it was launched in October 2023, analysts say the military government’s control over large population centres is secure as it wields an air force capable of staving off large-scale rebel advances. Northeastern Lashio city was also captured by the rebels but was handed back to the ruling military in April after a deal brokered by China. Since a 2021 military couptoppled the elected governmentof Aung San Suu Kyi and ignited a civil war in Myanmar, a myriad of pro-democracy armed groups and ethnic rebel armies have joined forces to fight against military rule. The groups in the Three Brotherhood Alliance, which also include the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army, have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy from Myanmar’s central government. The alliance is also loosely allied with the People’s Defence Force, a pro-democracy resistance group that has emerged to fight the military regime."
"Israel kills three in Gaza Catholic church sheltering elderly, children",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/israel-bombs-gazas-only-catholic-church-sheltering-elderly-and-children,,"Israeli forces have bombed Gaza’sonly Catholic church, killing three people and wounding at least 10 others, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said, as the military continues its assault across the besieged enclave. At least one person is in critical condition as a result of Thursday’s strike on the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, the Patriarchate said in a statement. The church’s priest was also lightly wounded, it added. Among those killed were the parish’s 60-year-old janitor and an 84-year-old woman who was receiving psychosocial support inside a Caritas tent in the church compound, according to the Catholic charity Caritas Jerusalem. Israeli attacks across Gaza on Thursday killed at least 32 Palestinians, including 25 in Gaza City alone, medical sources told Al Jazeera. Footage of the Holy Family Church attack published by a Palestinian activist and verified by Al Jazeera shows Father Gabriel Romanelli, the church’s pastor, following the Israeli attack. The video shows the priest with his right leg bandaged but otherwise in good condition. “The people in the Holy Family Compound are people who found in the Church a sanctuary – hoping that the horrors of war might at least spare their lives, after their homes, possessions, and dignity had already been stripped away,” the Patriarchate said in its statement after condemning the deadly attack.    Shadi Abu Dawoud, a 47-year-old Palestinian Christian, said the church’s main hall was housing dozens of displaced citizens, mainly children and elderly people, and that all were “peaceful civilians”. “My mother suffered serious injuries in the head; she was wandering in the church’s yard with other elderly women [when Israeli forces attacked],” he told Al Jazeera. “We were taken by surprise by this Israeli air strike. This is a barbaric and unjustifiable act.” Mohammed Abu Hashem, a 69-year-old man who lives beside the church, said he was in the ruins of his home when there was a huge explosion that covered the area in black smoke, adding that he never thought the Israelis would attack the church. “The Israeli air strike was massive, totally horrifying,” he said. “The horror we are living in is beyond description. No words could describe what we are living through. It is not even close to what you watch [on TV] or hear.” Father Bashar Fawadleh, the parish priest of Christ The Redeemer church in Taybeh, nearly Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said he spoke about the attack with the assistant parish priest of the Holy Family Church in Gaza City. “He told me that the bombing was very hard. They bombed the church itself,” Fawadleh told Al Jazeera.  “Our feeling is between hope and sorrow, between life and death.” Fawadleh reiterated calls for a ceasefire to stop the “horrible war in Gaza”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the strike to “stray ammunition”, adding that Israel was investigating the incident and “remains committed to protecting civilians and holy sites”. His statement was issued after a call from United States President Donald Trump, who had contacted the Israeli leader after having “not a positive reaction” to the strike, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “It was a mistake by the Israelis to hit that Catholic church, that’s what the prime minister relayed to the president,” Leavitt said. Reporting from Jordan’s capital Amman, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said Netanyahu issued the statement after coming “under pressure” from Trump, echoing the Foreign Ministry’s earlier announcement that an investigation was underway. “It’s a little bit hard to believe any sort of Israeli investigation that happens after 21 months of war because the military oftentimes absolves itself of any sort of wrongdoing. There is no one held accountable,” said Salhut. The ministry had also asserted Israel did not target churches or religious sites despiterepeated attackssince the start of the war on Gaza, she added. Pope Leo, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, said he was “deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack” on the Gaza church, according to a telegram signed on his behalf by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state. Pope Leo “assures the parish priest, Father Gabriele Romanelli, and the whole parish community of his spiritual closeness”, the telegram said. The pontiff renewed his “call for an immediate ceasefire, and he expresses his profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region”. His predecessor, the late Pope Francis, had heldnightly callswith the church’s parishioners in a show of solidarity with them. The last call took place the day before he died in April. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, said in comments toVatican Newsthat an Israeli tank hit the church “directly”. “What we know for sure is that a tank – the [Israeli army] says by mistake, but we are not sure about this – they hit the church directly, the Church of the Holy Family, the Latin church,” he added. Since the start of the war on Gaza, Israel has repeatedly attacked religious sites, including mosques and churches. In October 2023, just days after the deadly assault began, the Israeli army bombed the Church of Saint Porphyrius, the Gaza Strip’s oldest, killing at least 18 people.     An independent United Nations commission reportsaidlast month that Israel has committed the crime against humanity of “extermination” by attacking Palestinian civilians sheltering in religious sites and schools in Gaza. The report by the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, said Israel has destroyed more than half of all religious and cultural sites in the territory, as well as more than 90 percent of school and university buildings in Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas slammed the attack as “a new crime committed against places of worship and innocent displaced persons”. “It comes within the context of the comprehensive war of extermination against the Palestinian people,” the group said in a statement shared on Telegram. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also blamed Israel for the strike, saying attacks against “the civilian population that Israel has been carrying out for months are unacceptable”. Only about 1,100 Christians live in Gaza, according to a US Department of State report in 2024. The majority of Palestinian Christians are Greek Orthodox, but there are also Roman Catholics living there."
"Bangladeshi rap, memes helped oust Hasina — now they’re reshaping politics",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/11/rap-memes-graffiti-bangladeshs-new-political-tools-a-year-after-hasina,,"Dhaka, Bangladesh —On July 16, 2024, as security forces launched a brutal crackdown on student protesters campaigning against then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s increasingly authoritarian government, Bangladeshi rapper Massrur Jahan Alif — popularly known as Shezan — released a song. Titled Kotha Ko (speak up in Bangla), the song asked: “The country says it’s free, then where’s your roar?” It was the day that Abu Sayed, a protester, was killed, becoming the face of the campaign to depose Hasina after 15 years in power. Sayed’s death fuelled the public anger that led to intensified protests. And Shezan’s Kotha Ko, along with a song by another rapper, Hannan Hossain Shimul, became anthems for that movement, culminating in Hasina fleeing Bangladesh for India in August. Fast forward a year, and Shezan recently released another hit rap track. In Huddai Hutashe, he raps about how “thieves” are being garlanded with flowers – a reference, he said, to unqualified individuals seizing important positions in post-Hasina Bangladesh. As the country marks the anniversary of the uprising against Hasina, protest tools that played a key role in galvanising support against the former leader have become part of mainstream Bangladeshi politics. Rap, social media memes and graffiti are now also a part of the arsenal of young Bangladeshis looking to hold their new rulers accountable, just as they once helped uproot Hasina. As mob violence surged in Bangladesh last autumn in the aftermath of Hasina’s ouster, a Facebook meme went viral. It showed the familiar red and green seal of the Bangladesh government. But instead of the golden map of the nation inside the red circle, it depicted stick-wielding men beating a fallen victim. The text around the emblem had been tweaked – in Bangla, it no longer read “People’s Republic of Bangladesh Government,” but “Mob’s Republic of Bangladesh Government”. The satire was biting and pointed, revealing an uncomfortable side of post-Hasina Bangladesh. “It was out of this frustration that I created the illustration, as a critique on the ‘rule of mobs’ and the government’s apparent inaction,” said Imran Hossain, a journalist and activist who created the meme. “Many people shared it on social media, and some even used it as their profile picture as a quiet form of protest.” After the student-led revolution, the newly appointed interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus embarked on a sweeping reform agenda – covering the constitution, elections, judiciary and police. But mob violence emerged as a challenge that the government struggled to contain. This period saw mobs attacking Sufi shrines and Hindu minorities, storming women’s football pitches, and even killing alleged drug dealers – many of these incidents filmed, shared and fiercely debated online. “After the July uprising, some groups in Bangladesh – many of whom had been oppressed under the previous regime – suddenly found themselves with a lot of power. But instead of using that newfound power responsibly, some began taking the law into their own hands,” Hossain said. As with rap songs, such memes had also played a vital role in capturing the public mood during the anti-Hasina protests. After security officials killed hundreds of protesters on July 18 and 19, Sheikh Hasina was seen crying over damage to a metro station allegedly caused by demonstrators. That moment fuelled a wave of memes. One viral meme said “Natok Kom Koro Prio” (Do less drama, dear), and was viral throughout the latter half of July. It mocked Hasina’s sentimental display – whether over the damaged metro station or her claim to “understand the pain of losing loved ones” after law enforcement agencies had killed hundreds. Until then, ridiculing Sheikh Hasina had been a “difficult” act, said Punny Kabir, a prominent social media activist known for her witty political memes over the years, and a PhD student at the University of Cologne. While newspaper cartoonists previously used to lampoon political leaders, that stopped during Hasina’s rule since 2009, which was marked by arrests of critics and forced disappearances, she said. “To face off an authoritarian regime, it’s [ridiculing] an important and powerful tool to overcome fear and surveillance,” Kabir said. “We made it possible, and it broke the fear.” As fear of Sheikh Hasina faded from social media, more people found their voice – a reflection that soon spread onto the streets. Thousands of walls were covered with paintings, graffiti, and slogans of courage such as “Killer Hasina”, “Stop Genocide” and “Time’s Up Hasina”. “These artworks played a big role in the protests,” said political analyst and researcher Altaf Parvez. “Slogans like ‘If you are scared, you’re finished; but if you resist, you are Bangladesh’ – one slogan can make all the difference, and that’s exactly what happened. “People were searching for something courageous. When someone created something that defied fear – creative slogans, graffiti, cartoons – these became sources of inspiration, spreading like wildfire. People found their voice through them,” he added. That voice did not go silent with Hasina’s departure. Today, memes targeting various political parties, not just the government, are widespread. One of Imran’s works uses a Simpsons cartoon to illustrate how sycophants used to eulogise Hasina’s family for its role in Bangladesh’s 1971 liberation war when she was in power. Now, the cartoon points out, loyalists of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)’s leader Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman are trying to flatter their family for their contribution to the country’s independence movement. Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, led the freedom struggle, while Zia’s husband Ziaur Rahman was a senior army officer who announced the country’s independence on March 27, 1971. Another meme from a popular Gen-Z Facebook page called WittiGenZ recently highlighted allegations of sexual misconduct by a leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP) – a party formed by Bangladesh’s students. Political analysts in Bangladesh believe the tools that contributed to toppling Sheikh Hasina will continue to be relevant in the country’s future. “Memes and photo cards in Bangladesh essentially do what X does in the West. They provide the most effective short-form political commentary to maximise virality,” said US-based Bangladeshi geopolitical columnist Shafquat Rabbee. Bangladesh’s central bank unveiled new banknote designs inspired by the graffiti created by students during last July’s monsoon uprising, a nod to the art form’s widespread popularity as a means of political communication. And rap, Rabbee said, found a natural entry in Bangladeshi politics in 2024. “In Bangladesh’s context, back in July 2024, political street fighting became a dominant and fitting instrument of protest against Hasina’s repressive forces, he said. The artists behind the songs say they never expected their work to echo across Bangladesh. “I wrote these lyrics myself,” Shezan said, about Kotha Ko. “I didn’t think about how people would respond – we simply acted out of a sense of responsibility to what was happening.” As with Shezan’s song, fellow rapper Hannan’s Awaaz Utha also went viral online, especially on Facebook, the same day – July 18 – that it was released. “You hit one, 10 more will come back,” a line said. As Hasina found it, they did. The rappers themselves also joined the protests. Hannan was arrested a week after his song’s release and was only freed after Hasina resigned and fled to India. But now, said Shezan, rap was there to stay in Bangladesh’s public life, from advertising jingles to lifestyle. “Many people are consciously or subconsciously embracing hip-hop culture,” he said. “The future of rap is bright.”"
Gaza is running out of blood,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/12/gaza-is-running-out-of-blood,,"I live near Nasser Hospital in the west of Khan Younis city. Almost every day, I hear desperate calls for blood donations made on loudspeakers out of the hospital. It has been like that for more than a year. The hospital, like other barely functioning health facilities in Gaza, has been regularly overwhelmed with victims of continuing Israeli air attacks. Since the end of May, it has also received many victims shot by Israeli soldiers at aid distribution sites. I had donated blood before, and I felt it was my duty to do it again. So one morning last month, I headed to Nasser Hospital. While the blood was being drawn from my arm, I felt severe dizziness, and I thought I was going to faint. My friend, Nurse Hanan, who was one of the workers in the blood donation campaign, rushed to me and raised my legs to increase the blood flow to my brain until I felt better. She went to test my blood, and after 10 minutes returned to tell me that I was suffering from severe anaemia and malnutrition. My blood did not contain the minimum nutrients necessary for donation. Hanan told me that my case was not an exception. She explained that most of the people who visited the hospital to donate blood suffer from anaemia and malnutrition as a result of the ongoing Israeli blockade and the absence of nutritious food, such as meat, milk, eggs and fruits. Two-thirds of the blood units donated at the hospital have extremely low haemoglobin and iron levels, which makes them unusable for blood transfusions. In early June, DrSofia Za’arab, director of the Laboratory and Blood Bank, told the media that the severe shortage of donated blood units has reached “critical” levels, threatening the lives of patients, many of whom require urgent blood transfusions. The whole of Gaza needs 400 units daily. “Despite contacting the Ministry of Health in the West Bank to transfer blood units, the occupation authorities prevented their entry [into Gaza],” Dr Za’arab said. After the failed blood donation, I returned home crushed. I knew the famine was affecting me. I have lost a lot of weight. I suffer from constant fatigue, chronic joint pain, headaches, and dizziness. Even when I write my journalistic articles or study, I need to take short breaks. But the revelation of how bad my health condition is really struck me. For months now, my family and I have been eating only pasta and rice, due to the astronomical cost of flour. We eat one meal a day, and sometimes even half a meal to give more food to my younger siblings. I worry about them being malnourished. They have also lost a lot of weight and are constantly asking for food. We have not seen meat, eggs, or dairy products since Israel imposed the full blockade on March 2, and, even before that, we rarely did. The Gaza health authorities have said at least 66 children have died from starvation since the start of the Israeli genocidal war. According to UNICEF, more than 5,000 children were admitted to health facilities across the Strip for treatment of acute malnutrition in May, alone. Even if some of these children are miraculously saved, they will not have the opportunity to grow up healthy, to develop their full potential, and enjoy stable, secure lives. But beyond the anxiety I felt about the toll starvation has taken on my body and on bodies of my family members, I also felt pain because I had failed to help the wounded. I wanted to help those who are suffering from war injuries and fighting for their lives in the hospital because I am a human being. After all, the urge to help another person is one of the most human instincts we have. Solidarity is what defines our humanity. When you want to save a life but are prevented from doing it, it means a whole new horizon of despair has opened. When you want to help with whatever little you have – in this case, part of yourself – but are denied, this leaves a deep scar on the soul. For 21 months now, we have been denied all our human rights inscribed in international law: The right to water and food, the right to healthcare and housing, the right to education, the right to free movement and asylum, the right to life. Now, we have reached a point where even the urge to save others’ lives, the right to show human solidarity, is being denied to us. All this is not by chance, but by design. The genocide is not only killing people; it is also targeting people’s humanity and solidarity. From charities and food kitchens being bombed, to people being encouraged to carry knives and form gangs to rob and steal food, the strong solidarity that has kept the Palestinian people going through this genocide – through 75 years of suffering and dispossession – is directly under attack. Cracks may be appearing in our communal bonds, but we shall repair them. We are one big family in Gaza, and we know how to heal and support each other. The humanity of the Palestinian people has always stood victorious. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."
How US dealt with the cases of nine Americans killed by Israel since 2022,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/how-us-dealt-with-the-cases-of-nine-americans-killed-by-israel-since-2022,,"Washington, DC –The family ofSayfollah Musallet, the United States citizen who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank last week, is calling for justice. Musallet’s relatives want Washington to launch itsown investigationinto the incident to ensure accountability. The Florida-born 20-year-old is the ninth US citizen to be killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers since 2022. None of the previous cases have led to criminal charges or US sanctions against the perpetrators. That lack of response is what advocates call a “pattern of impunity”, wherein Washington demands a probe without placing any significant pressure on Israel to produce results. In Musallet’s case, the administration of President Donald Trumpurged Israelto “aggressively” investigate the killing. “There must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act,” Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, said in a statement on Tuesday. It is not clear if the US has taken any further actions to seek justice in the aftermath of the fatal beating. Critics say the “pattern of impunity” stems in part from the historically close bonds between the US and Israel. Successive presidential administrations in the US have affirmed their “unwavering” support for Israel, and the US provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid annually. Here, Al Jazeera looks at who the eight other victims were, how the US has responded to their killing and where their cases stand. Assad, a 78-year-old Palestinian American, was driving home in the occupied West Bank after visiting friends on January 12, 2022, when Israeli soldiers stopped him at a checkpoint. According to the autopsy report andhis family’s account, the troops dragged Assad out of his car and then handcuffed, gagged and blindfolded him, leaving him to die at a cold construction site.    The administration of then-President Joe Biden called on Israel to launch a criminal investigation into the incident. But Assad’s relatives and lawmakers from his home state of Milwaukee wanted Washington to conductits own probe– a demand that never materialised. As is often the case, Israel’s investigation into its own soldiers’ conduct did not lead to any criminal charges. In 2023, theIsraeli army saidthat it found no “causal link” between the way its soldiers treated Assad and his death. The Biden administration also declined to apply sanctions under US law to the Israeli unit that killed Assad: theNetzah Yehuda, a battalion notorious for its abuses against Palestinians in the West Bank. Last year, the US Department of State announced that the battalion will still be eligible for US aid under theLeahy Law, which prohibits military assistance for security units involved in human rights violations. Abu Akleh, a veteran Al Jazeera reporter, wasfatally shotby Israeli forces during a raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on May 11, 2022. Owing to her status as one of the most celebrated journalists in the Middle East, her killing sparked international outrage from rights groups and press freedom advocates. Despite the global attention, Israeli forcesattacked her funeralin Jerusalem, beating the pallbearers carrying her coffin with batons. Israel initially denied killing Abu Akleh, 51, falsely claiming that the reporter was shot by armed Palestinians. Months later, aftermultiple visual investigationsshowed that Israeli soldiers targeted Abu Akleh, Israel acknowledged that its forces likely killed the reporter, dismissing the incident as an accident. The Biden administration faced waves of pleas by legislators and rights groups to launchits own investigationinto the killing, but it resisted the calls, arguing that Israel is capable of investigating itself. In November 2022, Israeli media reports claimed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating the shooting of Abu Akleh, but the US Department of Justice never confirmed the probe. More than three years after Abu Akleh’s killing, her family and supporters say justice in her case has not been served. Born in Louisiana, Ajaq was 17 when he visited the occupied West Bank to see his relatives last year. On January 19, 2024, hewas drivinga pick-up truck with his friends when Israelis sprayed the vehicle with bullets and killed him. Mohammed Salameh, who witnessed and survived the attack, said the shooting was unprovoked. While it is not clear which individual shot Ajaq, Israel said the incident involved “an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian” and was sparked by “rock-throwing activities” – a claim that Salameh has denied. The US State Department called for an “urgent investigation to determine the circumstance” of the incident. But more than 19 months after the shooting, Israel has not publicly released any findings or charged any suspect in the shooting. “We feel abandoned by our government,” Ajaq’s uncle, Mohammad Abdeljabbar,told Al Jazeeralast year.    Khdour was also 17 when he was killed under almost identical circumstances to Ajaq just weeks later. According to his cousin Malek Mansour, who witnessed the attack, an unidentified assailant opened fire at their car in the occupied West Bank from a vehicle with an Israeli number plate. Mansour said the attack was unprovoked. Khdour died on February 10, 2024. The two had been eating cookies and taking selfies moments before the shooting. Once again, Washington called for a probe. “There needs to be an investigation. We need to get the facts. And if appropriate, there needs to be accountability,” then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at that time. But advocates say that, while normally Israel launches sham investigations into such incidents, Israeli authorities have not acknowledged Khdour’s killing at all. The Israeli military and police told the publication Haaretz last year that they are not familiar with the case. An Israeli air strike targeted aWorld Central Kitchen(WCK) vehicle in Gaza on April 1, 2024, killing seven aid workers, sparking anger and condemnation across the world. Among the victims was Flickinger, a 33-year-old US-Canadian dual citizen. Biden called for a “swift” Israeli investigation into the attack, which he said “must bring accountability”. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the blast a “tragic accident”. The Israeli military said the commander who ordered the strike had “mistakenly assumed” that gunmen in the area were in the aid vehicle. It added that the commander did not identify the car as associated with World Central Kitchen, a well-known hunger relief initiative founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres. A World Central Kitchen logo was displayed prominently on the top of the vehicle before the attack. Israel said it dismissed two commanders over the incident, but there were no criminal charges. Since then, Israel has killed hundreds of aid workers in Gaza, including Palestinianstaff members from World Central Kitchen. Last year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza as well as other alleged war crimes. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi Eygi, born in Washington state, was participating in a protest against an illegal settler outpost in the West Bank on September 6, 2024, when an Israeli soldier shot her in the head. She was 26. While there were reports of a scuffle during a crackdown on the demonstration by Israeli forces, several witnesses have saidthat Eygiwas shot during a calm period after the chaos had ended. The State Departmentcalled on Israelto “quickly and robustly” investigate Eygi’s killing, but it ruled out conducting its own probe. Biden dismissed her death as an “accident”, but Blinken condemned it as “unprovoked and unjustified”. On the same day that Eygi was fatally shot by Israel, the US Justice Department ​filed charges against Hamas leaders after the killing of US-Israeli captiveHersh Goldberg-Polinin Gaza. The Israeli military said its soldiers likely killed Eygi “indirectly and unintentionally” – a conclusion that her family called offensive, stressing that she was targeted by a sniper. “The disregard shown for human life in the inquiry is appalling,” the family said in a statement. Trump ally Randy Fine, now a Congress member, celebrated the killing of Eygi. “One less #MuslimTerrorist,” he wrote in a social media post, referring to the shooting.    When Jawad, a celebrated leader in the Lebanese Americancommunity in Michigan, was killed by an Israeli air strike in south Lebanon on October 1 of last year, the Biden administration initially denied he was a US citizen. Washington later acknowledged that Jawad was American, expressing “alarm” over his killing. “As we have noted repeatedly, it is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. Any loss of civilian life is a tragedy,” the US State Department said at that time. Israel has not commented publicly on the strike that killed Jawad. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) slammed the Biden administration’s handling of the case, including the US government’s initial “smug” response. “It’s as if they’re intentionally trying to see our people killed, intentionally downplaying us and dehumanising us,” ADC executive director Abed Ayoubtold Al Jazeeralast year.    On April 6, Israeli forces in the West Bank fatally shot14-year-old Rabee, a New Jersey native, and called him a “terrorist”. Two of his friends were also injured in the attack. While the Israeli military accused Rabee and his friends of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles, the slain teenager’s family insisted that he was picking almonds on the side of the road. The Trump administration failed to pursue accountability in the case or even publicly press for further details about the incident. Instead, the State Department cited the Israeli account about the 14-year-old’s killing. “We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” the State Department said at that time. “We acknowledge the [Israeli military’s] initial statement that expressed that this incident occurred during a counter-terrorism operation.”"
Canadian universities too should be in Francesca Albanese’s report,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/13/canadian-universities-too-should-be-in-francesca-albaneses-report,,"“Universities worldwide, under the guise of research neutrality, continue to profit from an [Israeli] economy now operating in genocidal mode. Indeed, they are structurally dependent on settler-colonial collaborations and funding.” This is what United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese wrote in her latest report“From economy of occupation to economy of genocide”, which documents the financial tentacles of Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and beyond. Its release prompted the United States’ governing regime to issuesanctions against Albanesein a move the Italian legal scholar rightly described as “obscene” and “mafia intimidation tactics”. The report reveals how universities not only invest their endowments in corporations linked to Israel’s war machine, but also engage in directly or support research initiatives that contribute to it. It is not only a damning indictment of the complicity of academia in genocide, but also a warning to university administrations and academics that they hold legal responsibility. In Israel, Albanese observes, traditional humanities disciplines such as law, archaeology, and Middle Eastern studies essentially launder the history of the Nakba, reframing it through colonial narratives that erase Palestinian histories and legitimise an apartheid state that has transitioned into what she describes as a “genocidal machine”. Likewise, STEM disciplines engage in open collaborations with military industrial corporations, such as Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries, IBM, and Lockheed Martin, to facilitate their research and development. In the United States, Albanese writes, research is funded by the Israeli Defence Ministry and conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with various military applications, including drone swarm control. In the United Kingdom, she highlights, the University of Edinburgh has 2.5 percent of its endowment invested in companies that participate in the Israeli military industrial complex. It also has partnerships with Ben-Gurion University and with companies supporting Israeli military operations. While Canadian institutions do not appear in Albanese’s report, they very easily could and, indeed, we argue, should. Canada’s flagship school, the University of Toronto (UofT), where one of us teaches and another is an alumnus, is a particularly salient example. Over the past 12 years, the UofT’s entanglements with Israeli institutions have snowballed, stretching across fields from the humanities to cybersecurity. They also involve Zionist donors (both individuals and groups), many of whom have ties with complicit corporations and Israeli institutions, and haveactively interferedwith university hiring practices to an extent that has drawn censure from the Canadian Association of University Teachers. This phenomenon must be understood in the context of the defunding of public higher education, which forces universities to seek private sources of funding and opens up universities to donor interference. After calls for cutting such ties intensified amid the genocide, the UofT doubled down on them over the past year, advertising artificial intelligence-related partnerships with Technion University in Haifa, joint calls for proposals with various Israeli universities, and student exchange programmes in Israel. The UofT also continues to fundraise for its “Archaeology of Israel Trust”, which was set up to make a “significant contribution to the archaeology of Israel” – a discipline that has historically focused on legitimising the Israeli dispossession of the Palestinian people. It also inaugurated a new lab for the study of global anti-Semitism, headed by Professor Ron Levi, whose research on hate speech is funded by the University of Toronto-Hebrew University of Jerusalem Research & Innovation Alliance. In addition to institutional partnerships, UofT’s Asset Management Corporation (UTAM), which manages the university’s endowment, uses asset managers that invest in companies named in Albanese’s report as complicit in the genocide in Palestine, including Airbnb, Alphabet Inc, Booking Holdings, Caterpillar, Elbit Systems, Leonardo, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir Technologies. A2024report found that 55 of these companies operate “in the military-affiliated defence, arms, and aerospace sectors” and at least 12 of UTAM’s 44 contracted investment managers have made investments totalling at least $3.95 billion Canadian dollars ($2.88bn) in 11 companies listed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as supporters of the construction and expansion of illegal settlements in the Palestinian territories. Furthermore, 17 of UTAM’s 44 contracted investment managers are responsible for managing around $15.79 billion Canadian dollars ($11.53bn) in assets invested in 34 companies identified by The American Friends Service Committee as benefiting from the ongoing genocide in Gaza. UofT is not unique among Canadian universities in this regard. According to a report on university divestment, Western University, too, promotes ongoing partnerships with Ben-Gurion University and invests more than $16m Canadian dollars ($11.6m) in military contractors and nearly $50 million Canadian dollars ($36.5) in companies directly complicit in the occupation of Palestine and the genocide of Palestinians. The list of complicit companies again includes Lockheed Martin, as well others listed by Albanese like Chevron, Booking Holdings, Airbnb, and Microsoft. McGill University, another top Canadian university, has also invested in Lockheed Martin, as well as notable military industrial companies like Airbus, BAE Systems, Safran, and Thales, which have also been accused of providing weapons and components to Israel. In the context of the ongoing genocide, students, staff, and faculty at such complicit universities – including at each of our respective institutions – have been demanding that their universities boycott and divest from Israel and companies profiting from its warfare. They are not only explicitly in the right according to international law, but are actually articulating the basic legal responsibility and requirement borne by all corporate entities. And yet, for raising this demand, they have been subjected to all manner of discipline and punishment. What Albanese’s report lays bare is that university administrators – like other corporate executives – are subject to and, frankly, should fear censure under international law. She writes, “Corporations must respect human rights even if a State where they operate does not, and they may be held accountable even if they have complied with the domestic laws where they operate. In other words, compliance with domestic laws does not preclude/is not a defence to responsibility or liability.” This means that those administrating universities in Canada and around the world who have refused to divest and disentangle from Israel and instead have focused their attention on regulating students fighting for that end are themselves personally liable for their complicity in genocide, according to international law. We could not possibly put it more powerfully or succinctly than Albanese herself does: “The corporate sector, including its executives, must be held to account, as a necessary step towards ending the genocide and disassembling the global system of racialized capitalism that underpins it.” It is our collective responsibility to make sure that happens at universities as well. Editor’s note: The article has been updated to clarify that Professor Ron Levi’s research is funded by the University of Toronto-Hebrew University of Jerusalem Research & Innovation Alliance and that UTAM uses asset managers that invest in companies deemed complicit in Israel’s actions in Gaza.

Tesla finally parks in India. But can it survive?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/tesla-finally-parks-in-india-but-can-it-survive,,"New Delhi, India –Tesla is finally cruising in India, the world’s third-largest car market, with the launch of its Model Y. Therolloutmarks the culmination of a decade-long, topsy-turvy journey. Showcased at its new showroom in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, on Tuesday, Tesla’s Model Y is now on sale for about $70,000, a price comparatively higher than in any other major market.     Elon Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company is braving high tariffs and stiff competition in India’s nascent but rapidly expanding EV market. As New Delhi negotiates a trade deal with the United States, India’s car sector tariffs, arguably among the highest in the world, are a central topic. “Tesla’s entry into India marks a significant expansion of the company’s global footprint,” said Kwan Wongwetsawat, a senior auto analyst at the research firm GlobalData. “Before this decision, Tesla faced several market challenges,” he said, ranging from geopolitical concerns, a decline in global sales, and an uncertain launch schedule for a new compact model. So, what’s the buzz aboutTeslacoming to India? Can it leverage the developing Indian market? And can India give a shoulder to Musk’s EV giant as itsglobal sales plummet? To start with, in India, Tesla has chosen to offer its Model Y in the mid-range luxury segment, combining its hallmark features: minimalist design, high performance, and long-range driving distance. The driver-assistance technology is available as an add-on for 600,000 Indian rupees, or $7,000. Tesla is offering two variants of Model Y in India: the rear-wheel drive (RWD) and the long-range RWD edition. While the RWD has a range of up to 500 kilometres (310 miles) on a single charge, the long-range variant has a range of 622km (386 miles). In the Indian market, the Model Y will go head-to-head with other premium electric SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz EQB, BMW iX1, Volvo EC40, and Kia EV6. Tesla offers a four-year, or 80,000km, vehicle warranty for the battery and drive unit, whichever comes first. “Tesla is the biggest EV company in the world, and its entry in India is a big milestone for the national EV industry,” said Puneet Gupta, who leads the India and Southeast Asia teams at automotive intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility. “It’s not just about selling cars in India. But Tesla’s entry can help India to build the EV ecosystem,” Gupta told Al Jazeera. “And the biggest impact of a company like Tesla is that it boosts people’s confidence in EVs as a category.” The Model Y reaches a top speed of 201km/h (125mph), with six coloured exterior finishes. It is equipped with standard features such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision alerts, blind spot monitoring, and lane departure warnings. Tesla’s signature Dashcam and Sentry Mode provide real-time recording and alerts for suspicious activity, even when the vehicle is parked. Tesla’s Model Y rear-wheel drive is priced at 6 million Indian rupees, or $70,000, while the long-range RWD edition is priced at about 6.8 million Indian rupees, or just below $80,000. Tesla’s website does not provide the price breakdown, including delineating the additional import tariff costs and levies imposed by a state. These prices for Model Y are higher than in any other major car market. They start at $44,990 in the United States, $36,700 in China, and $53,700 in Germany. India currently imposes one of the highest import duty tariffs on fully built cars in the world, significantly shooting up prices of foreign vehicles, including EVs like those from Tesla. Until recently, India imposed a 110 percent import duty on all fully built vehicles. The Indian government revised this policy, lowering the import duty to 15 percent for carmakers committing to invest and set up local manufacturing facilities within a three-year timeframe. This steep tariff structure has been a point of contention for global carmakers like Tesla, which has long lobbied for a reduction in duties to test market viability before committing to local manufacturing. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised and called out India as a “tariff king”. Both countries continue to negotiate a trade agreement, where the auto sector reportedly remains a central focus. Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has also noted that “import duties [in India] are the highest in the world by far of any large country!” India has set a national goal of achieving 30 percent EV adoption by 2030. While electric car sales in India increased by 20 percent in 2024 from the year before, EVs still represented just 2.5 percent of the total 4.3 million passenger vehicles sold. Despite its relatively small base, the EV sector in India is projected to grow rapidly, from its current market value of $54.41bn to $111bn by 2029. Currently, local manufacturers dominate the space, offering competitively priced EVs tailored to India’s cost-conscious consumers. Tata leads with approximately 60 percent of the market share in the electric car segment, followed by JSW MG Motor India – a collaboration between India’s JSW Group and China’s SAIC Motor – and then Mahindra & Mahindra. High-end electric cars, priced above $20,000, made up a minuscule 6.6 percent of total EV sales last year. This is where Tesla will have to compete with the likes of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, KIA and Audi. Tesla is coming to India as its EV sales plunge in global markets, and as the company bets on its revised Model Y to turn its fortunes around. In its home market, the US, sales continued to fall in the second quarter of 2025 by 6.3 percent, marking Tesla’s third straight quarterly drop in year-over-year domestic sales. Facing protests against Musk’s politics and earlier involvement with the Trump administration, sales have fallen for five straight months in Europe. With some consumers switching to cheaper Chinese EVs, Tesla’s market share has dropped to just 1.2 percent in May from 1.8 percent a year ago. In China, Tesla’s second-biggest market, the Q2 deliveries fell by nearly 12 percent. “Tesla has been facing tough times globally, so the company also desperately wants new markets, and India, being the world’s third-largest market, is a great opportunity for them to make up for some loss,” said Gupta of S&P Global Mobility. In several countries, Tesla’s Chinese competitors are outselling Musk’s EVs. And that’s where the vast Indian market comes into the equation for Tesla, noted experts. Due to geopolitical tensions between India and China, rival Asian neighbours, only a few Chinese EVs are pitching to the Indian market. In 2023, the Indian government rejected BYD’s proposal to establish a $1bn factory locally. While SAIC Motor operates in India in collaboration with India’s JSW Group, BYD relies on importing multiple models. “BYD is a direct competitor to Tesla, but the brand is also facing challenges in India and has yet to establish local production in the country,” said Wongwetsat. As a result, he added that both Tesla’s prices in India and those of BYD are higher than in other markets. “However, there is a clear price distinction between Tesla and local competitors like Tata, MG, and Mahindra,” placing Musk’s company in the luxury segment. Unlike other Chinese-dominated EV markets in Asia, India offers a rather open market for Tesla to introduce high-end features and build an ecosystem from the ground up. “The Chinese companies are not comfortable investing in India, and even Indian consumers are not comfortable buying Chinese due to the uncertain geopolitical situation,” said Gupta. “For now, the Indian market’s positioning is a very good advantage for Tesla, where you really don’t get competition from Chinese, which is really killing Tesla both in terms of price and features,” Gupta told Al Jazeera.    For starters, India, which has the world’s biggest population, is a starkly unequal country, where90 percentof the population does not have discretionary spending capacity. Tesla’s base offering is priced at $70,000, where, on a national average, per capita income is $2,880. Another concern is that India’s infrastructure, including the condition of its roads and poor traffic discipline, could pose challenges for Tesla vehicles’ lower ground clearance. India has only one charging station for every 235 EVs, with a total of 26,367 public charging stations nationwide for its 1.46 billion people. In contrast, the US has more than 61,000 charging stations for its 330 million people. At its media-only launch in Mumbai on Tuesday, Isabel Fan, Tesla’s regional director, said, “We are here to create the ecosystem, to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including the charging infrastructure.” Tesla announced that it will set up four charging stations in Mumbai. More will come to Delhi soon. “We are building from 0 to 100. It will take time to cover the whole country,” Fan said. Reading into the Indian EV market, Wongwetsat of GlobalData said that “Tesla’s arrival may not significantly impact overall battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in India, but it could attract demand from consumers interested in luxury brands like BMW and Audi.” Additionally, the launch of Tesla cars in India may be just one aspect of Tesla’s broader ecosystem, Wongwetsat said, which includes sectors such as solar energy, energy storage systems, and even the space industry, all of which could enhance Tesla’s appeal. Musk and the US president’s apparentpublic fallouttook a sharp turn earlier this month as Trumpthreatenedto cut off billions in federal environmental subsidies that have benefitted Tesla and Musk’s other companies. The clash follows Musk’s renewed criticism of Trump’stax and spending bill, which includes provisions to eliminate key clean energy incentives – specifically, the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that has long supported Tesla’s market growth. Trump, responding to Musk’s criticism, warned that the Tesla CEO could “lose a lot more” than just EV incentives. The dispute has broader implications. Musk has threatened to fund campaigns against lawmakers who back the bill and even floated the idea of launching a new political party."
"2026 FIFA World Cup: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia AFC qualifiers revealed",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/17/2026-fifa-world-cup-qatar-saudi-arabia-afc-qualifiers-revealed,,"The draw for the fourth round of Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup has revealed the fate of the final six teams from the continent vying for a place at next summer’s 48-team expanded edition. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the back-to-back AFC Cup winners, had already secured home advantage forthe next round of qualifiersbefore Thursday’s draw, which was made at AFC House, the headquarters of the football governing body on the continent, in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at what comes next forthe AFC nations that remain part of the qualifying process. Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Iraq, and Oman all missed out on qualification from the third round of AFC qualifiers but have progressed to the latest stage. Two more AFC teams will directly join the six that had already qualified in the third round for the World Cup. One intercontinental playoffs spot will still be available beyond the fourth round of qualifiers. Two round-robin groups will result in the top team from each taking Asia’s last two remaining automatic spots. Qatar will host Group A, which also contains the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Saudi Arabia welcomes Iraq and Indonesia into Group B. Saudi Arabia, who are attempting to qualify for a seventh World Cup finals since 1994, will host Group A and open against Indonesia on October 8. Indonesia will then play Graham Arnold’s Iraq on October 11 before the Saudis and Iraq face-off on October 14. Group B is hosted by Qatar, organisers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but who have never qualified for the finals. They will take on Oman in their first game on October 8. UAE will face the Omanis on October 11, with Qatar and the UAE meeting on October 14. The teams that finish second in the round-robin groups in the fourth round of AFC qualifiers will meet in a playoff over two legs, home and away, in November. The winner of that match progresses to intercontinental playoffs for the final 2026 FIFA World Cup place, which are scheduled for March 2026. Six teams from Asia secured qualification last month from the third round of qualifiers by finishing in the top two of the three groups at that stage. Japan, Iran, South Korea and Australia have all participated numerous times, whileJordan and Uzbekistanwill be making their first appearance. The European qualification rounds will not be completed until March, with the intercontinental playoff final scheduled for March 31. As a result, we will not knowthe final 48 teams for the World Cupuntil less than three months before the tournament. The United States, Canada and Mexico are jointly hosting the next edition of FIFA’s showpiece international event. The tournament begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends with the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19."
French court orders pro-Palestinian Lebanese fighter freed after 40 years,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/french-court-orders-pro-palestinian-lebanese-fighter-freed-after-40-years,,"A French court has ordered the release of pro-Palestinian Lebanese fighter Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, who has been imprisoned for 40 years for his role in the killings of two foreign diplomats in France in the early 1980s. The Paris Appeals Court ordered on Thursday that Abdallah, 74, be freed from a prison in southern France on July 25 on the condition that he leave French territory and never return. The former head of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Brigade was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 for complicity in the 1982 murders of United States military attache Charles Robert Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimantov in Paris and the attempted murder of US Consul General Robert Homme in Strasbourg in 1984. First detained in 1984 and convicted in 1987, Abdallah is one of the longest serving prisoners in France as most prisoners serving life sentences are freed after less than 30 years. The detainee’s brother, Robert Abdallah, told the AFP news agency in Lebanon on Thursday that he was overjoyed by the news. “We’re delighted. I didn’t expect the French judiciary to make such a decision nor for him to ever be freed, especially after so many failed requests for release,” he was quoted as saying. “For once, the French authorities have freed themselves from Israeli and US pressures.” Abdallah’s lawyer Jean-Louis Chalanset also welcomed the decision: “It’s both a judicial victory and a political scandal that he was not released earlier.” Abdallah is expected to be deported to Lebanon. Prosecutors may file an appeal with France’s highest court, the Court of Cassation, but it is not expected to be processed quickly enough to halt his release next week. Abdallah has been up for release for 25 years, but the US – a civil party to the case – has consistently opposed his leaving prison. Lebanese authorities have repeatedly said Abdallah should be freed from jail and had written to the appeals court to say they would organise his return home to Beirut. In November,a French court ordered his releaseon the condition Abdallah leaves France. But French prosecutors, arguing that he had not changed his political views, appealed the decision, which was consequently suspended. A verdict was supposed to have been delivered in February, but the Paris Appeals Court postponed it, saying it was unclear whether Abdallah had proof that he had paid compensation to the plaintiffs – something he has consistently refused to do. The court re-examined the latest request for his release last month. During the closed-door hearing, Chalanset told the judges that 16,000 euros ($18,535) had been placed in the prisoner’s bank account and were at the disposal of civil parties in the case, including the US. Abdallah, who has never expressed regret for his actions, has always insisted he is a “fighter” who battled for the rights of Palestinians and not a “criminal”. The Paris court has described his behaviour in prison as irreproachable and said in November that he posed “no serious risk in terms of committing new terrorism acts”. Abdallah still enjoys some support from several public figures in France, including left-wing members of parliament and Nobel Prize-winning author Annie Ernaux, but has mostly been forgotten by the general public."
Is Russia really ‘grooming’ Western AI?,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/8/is-russia-really-grooming-western,,"In March, NewsGuard – a company that tracks misinformation – publisheda reportclaiming that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, were amplifying Russian disinformation. NewsGuard tested leading chatbots using prompts based on stories from the Pravda network – a group of pro-Kremlin websites mimicking legitimate outlets, first identified by the French agency Viginum. The results were alarming: Chatbots “repeated false narratives laundered by the Pravda network 33 percent of the time”, the report said. The Pravda network, which has a rather small audience, has long puzzled researchers. Somebelievethat its aim was performative – to signal Russia’s influence to Western observers. Others see a more insidious aim: Pravda exists not to reach people, but to “groom” the large language models (LLMs) behind chatbots, feeding them falsehoods that users would unknowingly encounter. NewsGuard said in its report that its findings confirm the second suspicion. This claim gained traction, prompting dramatic headlines in The Washington Post, Forbes, France 24, Der Spiegel, and elsewhere. But for us and other researchers, this conclusion doesn’t hold up. First, the methodology NewsGuard used is opaque: It did not release its prompts andrefusedto share them with journalists, making independent replication impossible. Second, the study design likely inflated the results, and the figure of 33 percent could be misleading. Users ask chatbots about everything from cooking tips to climate change; NewsGuard tested them exclusively on prompts linked to the Pravda network. Two-thirds of its prompts were explicitly crafted to provoke falsehoods or present them as facts. Responses urging the user to be cautious about claims because they are not verified were counted as disinformation. The study set out to find disinformation – and it did. This episode reflects a broader problematic dynamic shaped by fast-moving tech, media hype, bad actors, and lagging research. With disinformation and misinformation ranked as the top global risk among experts by the World Economic Forum, the concern about their spread is justified. But knee-jerk reactions risk distorting the problem, offering a simplistic view of complex AI. It’s tempting to believe that Russia is intentionally “poisoning” Western AI as part of a cunning plot. But alarmist framings obscure more plausible explanations – and generate harm. So, can chatbots reproduce Kremlin talking points or cite dubious Russian sources? Yes. But how often this happens, whether it reflects Kremlin manipulation, and what conditions make users encounter it are far from settled. Much depends on the “black box” – that is, the underlying algorithm – by which chatbots retrieve information. We conductedour own audit, systematically testing ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Grok using disinformation-related prompts. In addition to re-testing the few examples NewsGuard provided in its report, we designed new prompts ourselves. Some were general – for example, claims about US biolabs in Ukraine; others were hyper-specific – for example, allegations about NATO facilities in certain Ukrainian towns. If the Pravda network was “grooming” AI, we would see references to it across the answers chatbots generate, whether general or specific. We did not see this in our findings. In contrast to NewsGuard’s 33 percent, our prompts generated false claims only 5 percent of the time. Just 8 percent of outputs referenced Pravda websites – and most of those did so to debunk the content. Crucially, Pravda references were concentrated in queries poorly covered by mainstream outlets. This supports the data void hypothesis: When chatbots lack credible material, they sometimes pull from dubious sites – not because they have been groomed, but because there is little else available. If data voids, not Kremlin infiltration, are the problem, then it means disinformation exposure results from information scarcity – not a powerful propaganda machine. Furthermore, for users to actually encounter disinformation in chatbot replies, several conditions must align: They must ask about obscure topics in specific terms; those topics must be ignored by credible outlets; and the chatbot must lack guardrails to deprioritise dubious sources. Even then, such cases are rare and often short-lived. Data voids close quickly as reporting catches up, and even when they persist, chatbots often debunk the claims. While technically possible, such situations are very rare outside of artificial conditions designed to trick chatbots into repeating disinformation. The danger of overhyping Kremlin AI manipulation is real. Some counter-disinformation experts suggest the Kremlin’s campaigns may themselves be designed to amplify Western fears, overwhelming fact-checkers and counter-disinformation units. Margarita Simonyan, a prominent Russian propagandist, routinely cites Western research to tout the supposed influence of the government-funded TV network, RT, she leads. Indiscriminate warnings about disinformation can backfire, prompting support for repressive policies, eroding trust in democracy, and encouraging people to assume credible content is false. Meanwhile, the most visible threats risk eclipsing quieter – but potentially more dangerous – uses of AI by malign actors, such as for generating malware reported by both Google and OpenAI. Separating real concerns from inflated fears is crucial. Disinformation is a challenge – but so is the panic it provokes.

‘We belong to this land’: Syrians navigate landmines to battle wildfires,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/11/we-belong-to-this-land-syrians-navigate-landmines-to-battle-wildfires,,"Qastal Maaf, Latakia, Syria –Abu Jameel Muhammed’s weathered hands, blackened by soot and ash, trembled as he patted the scorched earth around what remained of his beloved olive tree. At 80, the Syrian elder had survived abrutal civil war, economic collapse, and international sanctions – but the sight of his charred courtyard companion reduced him to tears. “Villagers rescued me as flames approached my home … I survived, but my only daughter on this land was consumed by fire. It was the last thing left for me here,” Abu Jameel said haltingly, his voice breaking as he referred to the cherished tree that had graced his small home in the Qastal Maaf area of Syria’s coastal Latakia province for decades. The elderly man lives alone in what has become theepicentre of wildfiresthat have ravaged Latakia for more than a week, surviving on money sent by daughters who married and moved abroad – a common story in a country where economic devastation has forced millions to seek opportunities elsewhere. “My home was the smallest but sweetest in the village… I surrounded it with rose bushes and had one precious olive tree in the courtyard. Now all is gone,” he told Al Jazeera, after the blaze consumed much of his village and forced thousands into displacement.    The scene around Abu Jameel’s destroyed home reflects a broader catastrophe unfolding across Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Wildfires have consumed more than 14,000 hectares (34,600 acres) of land over the past week, according to Syria’s Minister of Emergency and Disaster Management, Raed al-Saleh, who spoke to Al Jazeera by phone from the front lines. The steep, narrow roads leading to villages in Latakia’s highlands are covered in layers of black mud and ash, making access treacherous for emergency vehicles fighting the wildfires, which have continued despite the best efforts of the Syrian Civil Defense. The air is thick with acrid smoke that burns the throat and stings the eyes, while the once-green mountainsides have been transformed into a moonscape of charred earth and skeletal tree remains. Civil Defense volunteer Muhammed Baradei, 32, emerged from a cordoned-off area in Qastal Maaf during a rare break from battling the flames. His uniform was stained black by ash and humidity, and beads of sweat mixed with the soot covering his forehead and forearms. “I cancelled my leave when fires started near Latakia. I came from Idlib province to help,” Baradei said, describing a roughly 100km (62-mile) journey that would have been unthinkable during Syria’s civil war, as it meant crossing the line between the regime of former President Bashar al-Assad and the opposition. “We faced unexploded ordnance from past conflicts, steep terrain and shifting winds. Crews from multiple provinces contained many hot spots, but new fires kept igniting.” The inferno, which broke out on July 2, has been fuelled by high temperatures reaching about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) and strong, dry winds characteristic of Mediterranean summers. But this year’s fires carry particular significance for Syria, marking the first major natural disaster response since the fall of longtime dictator al-Assad, and the regime his father established more than 50 years ago, in December. Beyond the immediate challenges posed by steep terrain and unpredictable winds, firefighting teams face a uniquely Syrian hazard: the deadly legacy of more than a decade of conflict. “One of our greatest challenges was encountering unexploded ordnance and remnants of war,” said Wesam Zeidan, 29, a Civil Defense volunteer who drove from Hama province, far to the southeast of Latakia, to join the firefighting efforts. “These posed grave risks, forcing us to work with extreme caution and delaying access to affected zones.” According to the United Nations, Syria remains one of the world’s most contaminated countries in terms of explosive remnants of war, with an estimated 11.5 million people living in areas affected by explosive hazards.    The UN also estimates that there are 300,000 landmines still spread across Syria, ready to be ignited by people unknowingly setting them off. Just between December and June, 369 people were killed as a result of what the UN terms “explosive ordnance-related accidents”, including landmines and other explosive devices left behind by the war. These explosives can also be set off by fires raging in their vicinity. The hidden dangers, scattered across the landscape during years of fighting, now complicate every aspect of the firefighting response. Minister al-Saleh, who joined teams on the front lines, described the scale of damage to Syria’s forests as “heart-wrenching”. According to a statement from the Ministry of Emergency and Disaster Management, at least 12 people have been injured in the firefighting efforts: 10 volunteers suffered severe exhaustion, respiratory distress, fractures or contusions, while two civilians sustained minor burns. “During my field visits, I saw tremendous efforts to save Syria’s forests. Yet challenges grow with intense winds and buried landmines,” al-Saleh stated, highlighting the intersection of natural disaster and conflict legacy that defines much of Syria’s contemporary challenges. Syria has grappled with increasingly severe annual wildfires that have stretched the country’s sanctions-hit resources thin even as they were already strained by more than a decade of conflict. The 2020 fires were the worst ever recorded in Syria’s history, consuming tens of thousands of hectares across multiple provinces. This past experience, Baradei noted, drove villagers to evacuate promptly as flames approached their homes. “This significantly lowered the possibility of casualties,” he said. However, the dispersed nature of small, sometimes unofficial settlements scattered throughout the highlands has hampered firefighting efforts, he explained. Zeidan said dense forests and a lack of firebreaks have worsened the spread. The absence of firebreaks – vegetation-free zones intentionally created within forests to block wildfire spread and provide safety areas for ground crews – has been attributed to years of governmental neglect. “No sooner do we extinguish one fire than another ignites. Due to the dry season, unprecedented heatwaves and intense wind speeds, new hot spots keep erupting,” Zeidan said, his exhaustion evident after days of round-the-clock firefighting. Wind speeds increased dramatically on the second day of the fires, prompting multiple Syria Civil Defense centres and firefighting units from several provinces to mobilise. While they initially controlled numerous hot spots, flames had spread to new areas by the following morning, creating a cycle of containment and reignition that has defined the past week.    The change in Syria’s political landscape has fundamentally altered the firefighting response, according to volunteers and officials. During the 2011-2024 civil war, residents from opposition-controlled areas couldn’t enter government-held provinces due to security concerns and military checkpoints. “Before the Assad regime was toppled, we couldn’t visit these forests. We didn’t care that much when we saw similar news of fires in past summers,” Baradei explained. “But now the situation is different. We are here and we have to do something.” This newfound unity has mobilised firefighting teams from across Syria’s Civil Defense and Forestry Department. Syrian, Turkish, Jordanian and Lebanese aircraft hover above the blazes, providing aerial support for containment operations – a level of cooperation that would have been impossible under the previous government’s international isolation. Despite the threats posed by buried landmines and unexploded ordnance scattered across the landscape from years of conflict, Baradei said morale among Civil Defense teams remains high. “We are acutely aware of how dangerous these wildfires are for Syria,” he said. “These forests are part of our shared heritage. This is precisely what drives us … because we all belong to this land.” This piece was published in collaboration withEgab."
Trump’s African summit was a masterclass in modern colonial theatre,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/11/trumps-african-summit-was-a-masterclass-in-modern-colonial-theatre,,"On July 9, United States President Donald Trump opened a three-day mini summit at the White House with the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal – by subjecting his distinguished guests to a carefully staged public humiliation. This was not the plan – or at least, not the part the public was meant to see. A White House official claimed on July 3 that “President Trump believes that African countries offer incredible commercial opportunities which benefit both the American people and our African partners.” Whether by coincidence or calculated design, the meeting took place on the same day the Trump administration escalated its trade war, slapping new tariffs on eight countries, including the North African nations of Libya and Algeria. It was a telling contrast: Even as Trump claimed to be “strengthening ties with Africa”, his administration was penalising African nations. The optics revealed the incoherence – or perhaps the honesty – of Trump’s Africa policy, where partnership is conditional and often indistinguishable from punishment. Trump opened the summit with a four-minute speech in which he claimed the five invited leaders were representing the entire African continent. Never mind that their countries barely register in US-Africa trade figures; what mattered was the gold, oil, and minerals buried beneath their soil. He thanked “these great leaders… all from very vibrant places with very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people”. He then announced that the US was “shifting from AID to trade” because “this will be far more effective and sustainable and beneficial than anything else that we could be doing together.” At that moment, the illusion of diplomacy collapsed, and the true nature of the meeting was revealed. Trump shifted from statesman to showman, no longer merely hosting but asserting control. The summit quickly descended into a cringe-inducing display, where Africa was presented not as a continent of sovereign nations but as a rich expanse of resources, fronted by compliant leaders performing for the cameras. This was not a dialogue but a display of domination: A stage-managed production in which Trump scripted the scene and African heads of state were cast in subordinate roles. Trump was in his element, orchestrating the event like a puppet master, directing each African guest to play his part and respond favourably. He “invited” (in effect, instructed) them to make “a few comments to the media” in what became a choreographed show of deference. President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani of Mauritania led the way, both physically and symbolically, by praising Trump’s “commitment” to Africa. The claim was as misleading as it was surreal, given Washington’s recent aid cuts, punitive tariffs, and tightened visa restrictions on African nations. In one especially embarrassing moment, Ghazouani described Trump as the world’s top peacemaker – crediting him, among other things, with stopping “the war between Iran and Israel”. This praise came with no mention of the US’s continued military and diplomatic support for Israel’s war on Gaza, which the African Union has firmly condemned. The silence amounted to complicity, a calculated erasure of Palestinian suffering for the sake of American favour. Perhaps mindful of the tariffs looming over his own country, Ghazouani, who served as AU Chair in 2024, slipped into the role of a willing supplicant. He all but invited Trump to exploit Mauritania’s rare minerals, praised him and declared him a peacemaker while ignoring the massacres of tens of thousands of innocents in Gaza made possible by the very weapons Trump provides. This tone would define the entire sit-down. One by one, the African leaders offered Trump glowing praise and access to their countries’ natural resources – a disturbing reminder of how easily power can script compliance. Senegal’s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye even asked Trump to build a golf course in his country. Trump declined, opting instead to compliment Faye’s youthful appearance. Gabon’s President Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema talked of “win-win partnerships” with the US, but received only a lukewarm response. What did capture Trump’s attention was the English fluency of Liberia’s President Joseph Boakai. Ignoring the content of Boakai’s remarks, Trump marvelled at his “beautiful” English and asked, “Where did you learn to speak so beautifully? Where were you educated? Where? In Liberia?” That Trump seemed unaware English is Liberia’s official language, and has been since its founding in 1822 as a haven for freed American slaves, was perhaps less shocking than the colonial tone of his question. His astonishment that an African president could speak English well betrayed a deeply racist, imperial mindset. It was not an isolated slip. At a White House peace ceremony on June 29 involving the DRC and Rwanda, Trump publicly commented on the appearance of Angolan journalist and White House correspondent Hariana Veras, telling her, “You are beautiful – and you are beautiful inside.” Whether or not Veras is “beautiful” is entirely beside the point. Trump’s behaviour was inappropriate and unprofessional, reducing a respected journalist to her looks in the middle of a diplomatic milestone. The sexualisation of Black women – treating them as vessels of white male desire rather than intellectual equals – was central to both the transatlantic slave trade and European colonisation. Trump’s comment extended that legacy into the present. Likewise, his surprise at Boakai’s English fits a long imperial pattern. Africans who “master” the coloniser’s language are often seen not as complex, multilingual intellectuals, but as subordinates who’ve absorbed the dominant culture. They are rewarded for proximity to whiteness, not for intellect or independence. Trump’s remarks revealed his belief that articulate and visually appealing Africans are an anomaly, a novelty deserving momentary admiration. By reducing both Boakai and Veras to aesthetic curiosities, he erased their agency, dismissed their achievements, and gratified his colonial ego. More than anything, Trump’s comments on Boakai reflected his deeper indifference to Africa. They stripped away any illusion that this summit was about genuine partnership. Contrast this with the US-Africa Leaders Summit held by President Joe Biden in December 2022. That event welcomed more than 40 African heads of state, as well as the African Union, civil society, and private sector leaders. It prioritised peer-to-peer dialogue and the AU’s Agenda 2063 – a far cry from Trump’s choreographed spectacle. How the Trump administration concluded that five men could represent the entire continent remains baffling, unless, of course, this wasn’t about representation at all, but control. Trump didn’t want engagement; he wanted performance. And sadly, his guests obliged. In contrast to the tightly managed meeting Trump held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July 8, the lunch with African leaders resembled a chaotic, tone-deaf sideshow. Faye was especially disappointing. He came to power on the back of an anti-imperialist platform, pledging to break with neocolonial politics and restore African dignity. Yet at the White House, he bent the knee to the most brazen imperialist of them all. Like the others, he failed to challenge Trump, to assert equality, or to defend the sovereignty he so publicly champions at home. In a moment when African leaders had the chance to push back against a resurgent colonial mindset, they instead bowed – giving Trump space to revive a 16th-century fantasy of Western mastery. For this, he offered a reward: He might not impose new tariffs on their countries, he said, “because they are friends of mine now”. Trump, the “master”, triumphed. All the Africans had to do was bow at his feet. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."
Funeral for Gaza church attack after international condemnation,https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/7/18/funeral-for-gaza-church-attack-after-international-condemnation,,
"Israel’s narrative cannot survive the truth, so it’s silencing the world",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/18/israels-narrative-cannot-survive-the-truth-so-its-silencing-the-world,,"We are living in truly extraordinary times. We recently witnessed the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese,being sanctionedby the United States for doing her job – that is, documenting Israel’s abuses against Palestinians during its ongoing military assault on Gaza. But with more than 58,000 Palestinians killed to date in Gaza, the case for Israel is weaker than ever. So, for Israel’s sake, we need to silence and ban everything. Of course, silencing and censorship have been the modus operandi of the pro-Israel camp since October 2023. In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel, they came for all those who insisted that the history of Palestine and Israel did not begin on October 7, 2023, and for pointing to the longer history of occupation, settler colonialism, or the siege of Gaza since 2007 – they were silenced, censored, and punished. Those were the days of the now‑discredited reports of “beheaded babies”. Across the US and Europe, some faced death threats and social media attacks, while others were reprimanded by employers and line managers for criticising Israeli policies or publicly expressing pro-Palestinian views. In schools across Maryland, Minnesota, Florida and Arizona, teachers were suspended and student clubs shut down for pro-Palestine activism. University professors in the US and the United Kingdom were reported to the police for “liking” or sharing pro-Palestinian social media posts. In May 2024, Maura Finkelsteinbecame the first tenured academicto be dismissed for anti-Zionist speech. She was fired from Muhlenberg College after posting a Palestinian poet’s work. Between October 2023 and now, there have been scores of such cases around the world. Only a few days ago, four adjunct professors at the City University of New York were dismissed for their Palestine solidarity activism. Then theycame for the press. While the foreign press has been banned from entering Gaza, Palestinian journalists there have been treated as legitimate military targets by Israel. On average,13 journalists have been killed per month– a toll higher than that of “both World Wars, the Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia and the United States war in Afghanistan combined”. It is the deadliest conflict for media workers ever recorded. Elsewhere, journalistic voices – especially those of Middle Eastern or North African descent – have been systematically silenced for supporting the Palestinian cause or criticising the Israeli government. This includes Australian radio hostAntoinette Lattouf, who was dismissed in December 2023 after posting a Human Rights Watch report alleging that “Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza”. Palestinian-Canadian journalists Yara Jamal (CTV) and Zahraa al-Akhrass (Global News, during maternity leave) were both sacked in October 2023, following pressure from Honest Reporting Canada. Briahna Joy Gray and Katie Halper were also fired from Hill News for statements critical of Israel. Gray announced on X: “The Hill has fired me … there should be no doubt that … suppressing speech – particularly when it’s critical of the state of Israel.” Beyond dismissals, Western media executives have shaped the narrative, repeating Israeli propaganda, mischaracterising Palestinian activism as pro-Hamas or anti-Semitic, portraying Israelis as victims far more often than Palestinians, and whitewashing Israeli war crimes in Gaza. The BBC, in particular, has facedrepeated criticismfor its pro-Israel bias. From the language used in headlines to the disproportionate airtime given to Israeli officials, its reporting has consistently been accused of downplaying Palestinian suffering and mirroring Israeli government talking points. Staff resignations,open letters, and public protests have all challenged the broadcaster’s editorial stance on Gaza. At Upday, Europe’s largest news aggregator owned by Axel Springer, employees were instructed to “colour the company’s coverage of the war in Gaza with pro‑Israel sentiment”. Internal documents obtained by The Intercept revealed staff were told not to “push anything involving Palestinian casualty tolls” unless “information about Israel” was given “higher up in the story”. There is more. After October 7, students atHarvardwere subjected to terrifying doxxing campaigns labelling them anti-Semitic or terrorist sympathisers, their photos and personal data shared publicly. As Israel’s scholasticide continued in Gaza, the silencing spread on campuses across the US and Europe.Palestine solidarity encampmentssaw students demanding their institutions cut ties with Israeli universities and the military‑industrial complex. They faced brutal police crackdowns, suspensions, and some were denied graduation. Universities swiftly imposed new restrictions on gatherings and protests to curb student Palestine solidarity. Now, under a Trump administration, such suppression is public policy, extending to threats of arrest, denaturalisation and deportation for pro‑Palestinian voices, including lawmakers like NYC mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani. Trump falsely labelled him “illegal”, branded him a “communist”, and threatened arrest if he obstructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “operations” – echoing GOP Representative Andy Ogles’s call for denaturalisation and deportation, citing alleged misrepresentations in Mamdani’s naturalisation without any evidence. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the Justice Department had received related requests. We have also seen Palestinian flags banned at sporting and music events. Individuals have been refused entry into public venues and businesses for wearing a keffiyeh. The International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, was warned that he and the ICC would be “destroyed” if they did not drop the case against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Four ICC judges were sanctioned by the US government. Academy Award‑winner Susan Sarandon was dropped by her talent agency, UTA, for remarks at a Palestine solidarity rally. Melissa Barrera was dismissed from the cast of Scream VII for social media posts describing Israeli actions as genocide and ethnic cleansing. Spyglass Media Group stated it has “zero tolerance for antisemitism … including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion”. Recently, performers like Bob Vylan and Irish group Kneecap used their platforms at music festivals to show solidarity with Palestine. The group now faces terror charges. Vylan’s shows in Europe were cancelled, and his US visa revoked, putting an upcoming tour of the country in doubt. The pro-Israel camp also launched a campaign against the Glastonbury Festival after both artists performed there in June. They targeted the BBC for airing the performances live and pressured organisers to distance themselves from the musicians. The backlash made clear that even major cultural institutions are not safe from censorship efforts. Adding to this troubling trend, widely respected Israeli‑American historian and genocide scholar Omer Bartov has become a focal point of a fierce backlash. In an op‑ed for The New York Times, titled “I’m a Genocide Scholar. I Know It When I See It”, Bartov declared that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, pointing to the systematic infrastructure destruction, forced population shifts and rhetoric by Israeli leaders, arguing it matches both UN and legal definitions of genocide. Since then, he has been slammed by pro‑Israel factions, accused of misapplying the term and urged to be “cancelled”, a campaign he rebuts by highlighting that many genocide studies experts share his conclusion. The reputational assault currently faced by Bartov demonstrates how even the world’s leading genocide experts are now being targeted for naming Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide. This may already appear to be an extensive campaign of suppression. But consider: what does it say about Israel’s position if it relies so heavily on censorship? Nonetheless, it remains insufficient. For Israel’s sake, every student, academic, activist, musician, artist or lawmaker who criticises its policies must now be branded a terror supporter. Every civil society organisation, human rights group or international body documenting Israeli abuses must be labelled anti-Semitic. Only then can we claim we saw nothing. Only then can we say we heard nothing. And only then can we justify why we did nothing when the genocide was ongoing in Gaza.

UN talks with Cypriot leaders fail to reach deal on new border crossings,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/un-talks-with-cypriot-leaders-fail-to-reach-deal-on-new-border-crossings,,"The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said he would have liked more results from his meetings with the rival leaders of the divided island of Cyprus, while the Turkish Cypriot leader said he was “very, very upset” that there was no agreement on opening four new border crossings. Guterres on Thursday called the meetings at the UN in New York “constructive” and pointed to progress on four of the six initiatives that the leaders had agreed to in March. He cautioned, however, that “there’s a long road ahead.” The Mediterranean island was divided in 1974 when Turkiye invaded, following a coup by Athens’ military government-backed supporters to unite the island with Greece. Mass deaths and displacement of the Greek Cypriot population followed as the island’s northern third was occupied – only Turkiye recognises a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence, and it maintains more than 35,000 troops in the north. Negotiations between the rivals have been stalled since 2017. When asked whether he would start a new round, Guterres responded that there is more to be done before any negotiations. “I think we are building, step by step, confidence and creating the conditions to do concrete things to the benefit of the Cypriot people,” the secretary-general said. The agreed-upon, UN-endorsed framework for a peace deal has been a reunified Cyprus as a federation composed of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones. Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar has been demanding a two-state deal ever since his 2020 election. He faces re-election in October and says he’s running on the same two-state platform with Ankara’s full backing. Greek Cypriots reject any agreement that would formalise partition, fearing Turkiye would seek to control the entire island in light of its demand to maintain a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in Cyprus. Turkiye also insists that the minority Turkish Cypriots should have veto rights over all federal government decisions. The meeting included the foreign ministers of guarantor countries Turkiye and Greece, and a United Kingdom deputy minister. Despite differences on the future of Cyprus, the rivals have made some progress on trust-building measures.    Guterres told reporters that four initiatives had been achieved: Creating a technical committee on youth; initiatives on the environment and climate change, including the effect on mining areas; the restoration of cemeteries; and an agreement on demining, where technical details still need to be finalised. He said discussions will continue on opening four new crossings between the Greek and Turkish sides of the island, and on solar energy in the buffer zone between them, which is patrolled by a UN peacekeeping force. Tatar accused Nikos Christodoulides, the president of Cyprus, of preventing the announcement of the four border crossings on Thursday by insisting that one of them go through the buffer zone, which he called unacceptable to Turkish Cypriots. He also sharply criticised Greek Cypriots for pursuing legal action over the sale of properties in the Turkish Cypriot north, saying the moves “are certainly damaging to the relations of the two peoples and are aimed at damaging our economy and our tourism”. Property rights are a deeply contentious issue in Cyprus. A recent boom in the construction of luxury villas and apartments in the north has prompted Cypriot legal authorities to take a more assertive stance towards realtors and developers, to discourage what they say is the large-scale “illegal usurpation” of Greek Cypriot land. The secretary-general said Tatar and Christodoulides agreed to meet with him in late September, during the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly, and to hold another informal meeting later in the year."
How selling parrots to a Pakistani journalist led to a locked bank account,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/17/how-selling-parrots-to-a-pakistani-journalist-led-to-a-locked-bank-account,,"Islamabad, Pakistan –Rozi Khan, a 29-year-old bird seller from Karachi, was on a business trip to Islamabad in April when he discovered he could not access his bank account. After completing a sale with a customer, he tried to withdraw money from an ATM, only to be met with the message: “Invalid bank account”. Alarmed, Khan took the next available flight back home and rushed to speak to his bank manager. He was shocked to discover that the account, which he had been using for his bird-selling business for 10 years, had been shut down on April 10 on the orders of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), without any explanation. Khan managed to speak to an FIA official on the phone after being given a number to call by his bank manager. After asking about Khan’s recent business transactions, the official posed a puzzling question: What was his relationship with Asad Ali Toor, a journalist and avid collector of rare parrots? “I did not understand the question at first. I sell birds to people from every walk of life – lawyers, military officers, anyone,” Khan told Al Jazeera. “I sold parrots to Asad as well. Why would they suspend my account for dealing with a customer who just happens to be a journalist?” In Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sargodha and other cities, the same question has been echoing in the minds of other people, particularly bird sellers, who have conducted business with Toor and then found themselves locked out of their bank accounts. Nadeem Nasir, a 60-year-old businessman in Lahore who has sold birds in the past, including to Toor, discovered his account had been closed on April 10 when a cheque he wrote to an associate bounced. “I have known Asad for the last five years and have developed good relations with him. But the last time he purchased parrots from me was in 2023 and early 2024. Since then, there has been no business transaction between us,” Nasir told Al Jazeera. Like Khan, Nasir said he received no notification that his account had been closed from either the FIA or the bank. When he finally spoke to someone at the FIA, he, too, was questioned about his connection to Toor. “It was only after I managed to get in touch with some FIA officials through my contacts that they asked me about my relationship with Toor. That’s when I realised what had happened,” he said. Toor, 40, is an Islamabad-based independent journalist and vlogger, who has earned a reputation for his outspoken opinions. He runs a popular YouTube channel and is well known for his critical analysis of the government, judiciary and Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which has ruled the country directly for more than three decades and continues to wield enormous influence. He also collects birds. Among the many bank accounts blocked by the FIA were those of Toor himself as well as of his father, mother, brother and a cousin who helped him run his YouTube channel. This wasn’t Toor’s first run-in with the authorities. He has been running his YouTube channel for the past five years, attracting 335,000 subscribers while more than 355,000 people follow him on X. In 2021 while the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was in power,Toor was attackedby unknown people at his home in Islamabad. He said he believed his assailants were members of the military intelligence service, which has been accused by rights groups of involvement in disappearances and extrajudicial killings in the past. At the time, the military’s media wing did not comment after questions about the allegation. In February 2024, Toor wasarrestedon charges of orchestrating a “malicious campaign” against the state through social media. He was released after 18 days in custody. Then last week, Toor’sYouTube channelwas among 27 Pakistani channels that authorities sought to suspend for “anti-state” content. Although a magistrate initially approved thesuspension, a sessions court reversed the order two days later. Toor’s passion for rare parrots is well known. He owns several dozen birds and spends more than 50,000 rupees ($175) each month on their care, a hobby he funds through his online earnings. “I only found out about the account suspension after my cousin told me his account had been frozen due to transactions with me,” Toor told Al Jazeera. “As I looked into it, I discovered that my own account along with those of my family and even my bird sellers had been locked without any prior warning or notification from the bank or the FIA.” For more than a month, Toor had no access to his funds and has been forced to rely on friends for financial support. Finally in May, the Islamabad High Court issued an order in response to a petition he had lodged, ordering that his bank account be restored. When Judge Khadim Hussain Soomro asked the FIA to justify the freeze, the agency submitted a one-page reply stating it needed to investigate Toor’s income, allegedly earned through “anti-state, anti-government posts” on social media. The statement further claimed that the agency was examining potential “traces of money laundering and terror funding” through “various bank channels”. But the court ruled Toor had been denied due process, the action, therefore, was unlawful and ordered the FIA to restore the journalist’s account. The bank accounts of Toor’s family members, however, remain blocked. Zainab Janjua, Toor’s lawyer, said it took her more than a week to get her client’s account unblocked after the ruling. “The court order clearly stated that the accounts should be unblocked immediately, but the banks refused to comply until they had received written confirmation from the FIA,” she told Al Jazeera. Eventually, Janjua’s colleague and Toor went to the bank and threatened contempt proceedings, after which the account was unlocked. “The bank manager was named in our petition. We warned them that if the account wasn’t restored, they’d face contempt of court charges. Only then did they comply,” she said. The FIA did not respond formally to questions from Al Jazeera, but an FIA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that the investigation into Toor was necessary due to what he called “unusual” financial activity. “Asad Toor has spent millions of rupees on parrots, and his only income appears to be from YouTube. Is that not strange?” the official said. He added that under antimoney-laundering laws, the FIA is authorised to investigate any financial dealings that appear suspicious. “Our goal was to question these individuals, including Toor and his associates, and understand what’s happening. That’s why we froze the accounts,” he said. However, the official declined to explain why no prior notice was issued to any of the affected individuals. He said those affected should write to the FIA after court orders to unblock their accounts if they want them reopened. Another journalist known for his critical stance towards the state is Matiullah Jan, who is in his 50s and also lives in Islamabad, where he hosts a show on the news channel Neo News and also runs his own YouTube channel, MJTv. He underwent a similar ordeal in April when the accounts of his wife and sister were frozen. Jan has previously been harassed and arrested on various charges. Last year, he was detained by the police on drug charges, which he denied, before eventually being cleared by a court. His YouTube channel was one of the 27 flagged by authorities last week along with Toor’s. Jan said there was no formal notice from the FIA that the accounts were being frozen. “My sister’s account was restored after my lawyer brother intervened. My wife’s account was unblocked a month later only after the bank couldn’t produce any written suspension order,” Jan told Al Jazeera. Nasir and Khan, the bird sellers, took their case to court in Islamabad as well. On July 3, a court ruled in favour of both of them and ordered their bank accounts to be reopened. Nasir finally managed to get access to his account on July 5, more than two months after it had been suspended. “Thankfully, I could still rely on my children for help. But my main concern was paying for my wife’s cancer medication. It’s deeply frustrating how easily the state can punish someone without explanation or apology,” Nasir said. In Karachi, Khan hasn’t been as fortunate. Despite the court order, he said he still cannot access his account. He said the suspension is hurting his business because he now has to rely on his brothers to facilitate transactions. His customers, he said, often seem suspicious about why he can’t provide details of a personal bank account. “The government wants us to go cashless, to operate digitally and then shuts our accounts without explanation. What do I tell my customers? That doing business with another customer got my account frozen?” a frustrated Khan asked. Pakistan remains one of the most restrictive countries in terms of news media freedom as journalists face constant threats to their security and livelihoods. In its latest report, Human Rights Watch said journalists in Pakistan “faced intimidation, harassment, and digital and physical surveillance for perceived criticism of the government”. In the news media freedom rankings compiled by Reporters Without Borders in May, Pakistan dropped by five levels from number 152 to 158 out of 180 countries. Farieha Aziz, a rights activist, said journalists are increasingly being targeted via legal tools and state agencies like the FIA. “This is about using the legal system to wear people down, dragging them into courts, forcing them to hire lawyers. It’s nothing short of legal harassment and a culture of collective punishment,” she told Al Jazeera. Khan, who is still awaiting restoration of his account, said he holds no grudge against Toor but wants to know what crime he’s being punished for. “Does this mean if I talk to someone the state doesn’t like, they can freeze my account? At least tell me what I did wrong. Issue a notice to me if you want. But you can’t punish me silently when I’ve done nothing,” he said."

But his grassroots campaign mobilised a multicultural coalition of voters, in part, by speaking directly to them — in their native tongue. The government of New York state estimates that New Yorkers speak more than 800 languages, and as many as 2.5 million struggle with communicating in English. Experts, however, say Mamdani successfully used his skills in multiple languages to appeal to voters who often are not targeted by mainstream election campaigns, highlighting policy proposals targeting voters’ biggest concerns, like affordability. Moments after ranked-choice voting totals were finalised, Mamdani’s team posted a campaign message garnering more than5.7 million views on X alone, explaining a five-point breakdown of “What We Won on Election Day”: Trump voters, Adams voters, new voters, coalitions and turnout. “Most campaigns focus on ‘triple primes’ – New Yorkers who voted in the last three primaries,” said Mamdani. “But this strategy ignored most of our city. We knew we could turn them out if they saw themselves in our policies.” Speaking between clips of himself using Hindi, Urdu and Spanish, Mamdaniexplained, “We ran a campaign that tried to talk to every New Yorker, whether I could speak their language or simply tried. And the coalition that came out on Tuesday reflected the mosaic of these five boroughs.” Among the areas Mamdani won by large margins were South Asian neighbourhoods such as City Line, Ozone Park and Jamaica Hills; Latino neighbourhoods including Corona, Washington Heights, Pelham Bay and Woodhaven; and Chinese communities in Flushing, Chinatown and Bensonhurst. A Ugandan-born South Asian Muslim immigrant himself, Mamdani speaks both Hindi and Urdu – a fluency that allowed him to extend his reach to voters through social media videos. His mother Mira Nair is herself a filmmaker, known for movies like Salaam Bombay!, Monsoon Wedding and Mississippi Masala. Soniya Munshi, associate professor in urban studies and adviser to Asian-American community studies at Queens College, told Al Jazeera that these types of videos worked as conversation starters through Bollywood references that span the decades – from the 1970s onwards – recognisable to many South Asian diasporas of different ages and with different pathways to the US. “I saw his Hindi/Urdu video move from Instagram to text chats among second-generation South Asians to WhatsApp family threads to discussions about Zohran’s platform for an affordable NYC,” said Munshi, who herself is a second-generation South Asian New Yorker. “These videos opened up a bigger conversation with friends, families and communities about our experiences, our conditions, our own hopes for the city we call home, and they also moved voters to come out for Mamdani.” More than half of New York City’s South Asian population is of Indian descent, but Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities have seen the most growth over the past two decades. South Asians now make up 22.5 percent of the city’s Asian population, most of them immigrants. Mamdani’s campaign materials – in Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Bengali and other languages – spoke directly to immigrant New Yorkers about the material issues affecting their lives. “It’s critical to note the significance of Mamdani’s videos in Hindi/Urdu and Bangla,” said Munshi. “These two communities are among those with the highest levels of limited English proficiency households, essential workers, and poverty rates of all immigrant groups in NYC … Ultimately, what made these South Asian language videos so powerful was the culturally relevant references combined with the direct message of his vision and platform.”    Chowdury Md Moshin, 68, a native of Bangladesh who now lives in Jackson Heights, sat in Travers Park on a warm late June day reading a newspaper, his stark white hair and shirt contrasting with the bright green of the swaying trees around him. A speaker of Bengali or Bangla himself, Moshin appreciated hearing from a mayoral candidate speaking a language he understands. “I think he will be a good mayor and will make New York City cleaner,” said Moshin. “I love him.” Inone of the videosposted during the final push before the Democratic primary election, Mamdani demonstrated ranked-choice voting with Council Member Shahana Hanif’s 39th New York City Council District, using a plate of mishti doi, a sweet yoghurt dessert from the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. “His Bangla-language video with Shahana Hanif, the first Bangladeshi Muslim woman to serve as city councilperson in NYC, was also significant,” said Munshi. “Bangla is not a South Asian language Mamdani is fluent in, and we see him making a good effort to speak with Hanif about the election.” The digital agency behind this content, as well as Mamdani’s first viral video withover 3.5 million views on X, is called Melted Solids. The Brooklyn-based collective, founded in 2019 by Anthony DiMieri and Debbie Saslaw, has worked with Mamdani on various campaigns since as early as 2021. In an interview with Adweek, Saslaw spoke to the 2025 primary, saying, “I’m [a] marketer and storyteller, and what I thought was necessary and needed in the political space was the ability to speak to regular New Yorkers, like using advertising … as a vessel to hear their concerns.” Mara Einstein, digital marketing critic and author of Hoodwinked: How Marketers Use the Same Tactics as Cults, told Al Jazeera that, “They [Melted Solids] know him, which is why they could produce content that conveyed his specific voice.” “They are also not a traditional agency,” added Einstein. “What Melted Solids did that was different is get rid of the red, white, and blue colour scheme that has dominated political campaigns. Purple and yellow/gold [colours used by Mamdani’s campaign for flyers, signs and branding] is striking and unexpected. The typography harkens back to grocery store signs, giving it a neighbourhood-y, everyman feel.” For a campaign run on affordability and reaching every New Yorker, this analysis bodes well. But ultimately, experts say that Mamdani’s social media engagement performed well because his vision and platform were at the core of all of his content. “The social media content was delightful to watch, well-produced, and engaging, but what was most important was that it had substance,” said Munshi. “It gave us something to talk about that was bigger than Mamdani as an individual or even his campaign. It activated something at a collective level.” Outside the polls in Woodside on election day, Munshi asked an older Spanish-speaking Latina woman whom she planned to vote for. The woman reached into her purse, pulled out a worn Working Families Party flyer, and pointed to Mamdani’s face. “Him,” she said. “I like how he talks.” “To me, this indicated that Mamdani’s communication wasn’t just about the language he is speaking in,” said Munshi. “But how he used language – clear, simple, focused, relatable to New Yorkers who are concerned with their everyday needs in this city.” With five months until the general election, Mamdani and Melted Solids still have work to do as they face off against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who isbacked by US President Donald Trump. But if former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo’s failed 2025 mayoral bid – backed by $25m raised by the super PAC Fix the City – is any indication, Einstein said, “No marketing, no matter how good it is, can sell a bad product. Cuomo is evidence of that.”"

UN rapporteur demands global action to stop Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/un-rapporteur-demands-global-action-to-stop-israels-genocide-in-gaza,,"The United Nations’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territory has said that it is time for nations around the world to take concrete actions to stop Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza. Francesca Albanese spoke to delegates from 30 countries meeting in Colombia’s capital, Bogota, on Tuesday to discuss Israel’s brutal assault and ways nations can try to stop the offensive in the besieged enclave. Many of the participating nations have described Israel’s war on Gaza as agenocide against the Palestinians. More than 58,000 people have been killed since Israel launched the assault in October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israeli forces have also imposed several total blockades on the territory throughout the war, pushing Gaza’s 2.3 million residents to the brink of starvation. “Each state must immediately review and suspend all ties with the State of Israel … and ensure its private sector does the same,” Albanese said. “The Israeli economy is structured to sustain the occupation that has now turned genocidal.” The two-day conference organised by Colombia and South Africa is being attended mostly by developing nations, although Spain, Ireland and China have also sent delegates. The conference is co-chaired by South Africa and Colombia, which last year suspended coal exports to Israeli power plants. It includes the participation of members of The Hague Group, a coalition of eight countries that earlier this year pledged to cut military ties with Israel and comply with anInternational Criminal Court arrest warrantagainst Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. For decades, South Africa’s governing African National Congress party has compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank with its own history of oppression under the harsh apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to areas called “homelands”, before ending in 1994. The gathering comes as the European Union weighs various measures against Israel, which include a ban on imports from illegal Israeli settlements, an arms embargo and individual sanctions against Israeli officials who are found to be blocking a peaceful solution to the conflict.    Colombian Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo said on Monday that the nations participating in the Bogota meeting, which also include Qatar and Turkiye, will be discussing diplomatic and judicial measures to put more pressure on Israel to cease its attacks. The Colombian official described Israel’s conduct in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as an affront to the international order. “This is not just about Palestine,” Jaramillo said in a news conference. “It is about defending international law and the right to self-determination.” Special rapporteur Albanese’s comments echoed remarks she made earlier on Tuesday addressed to the EU. The bloc’s foreign ministers had been meeting in Brussels to discuss possible action against Israel. In a series of posts on X, Albanese wrote that the EU is “legally bound” to suspend its association agreement with Israel, citing its obligations under international law. Albanese said the EU is not only Israel’s top trading partner but also its top investment partner, nearly double the size of the US, and “trade with an economy inextricably tied to occupation, apartheid and genocide is complicity”."
Slovenia bars far-right Israeli cabinet ministers Ben-Gvir and Smotrich,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/slovenia-bars-far-right-israeli-cabinet-ministers-ben-gvir-and-smotrich,,"Slovenia has banned far-right Israeli cabinet ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich from entering the country. Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon declared the pair personae non gratae on Thursday in what she said was a first for a European Union country. “We are breaking new ground,” she said. In a statement, the Slovenian government accused Israel’s National Security MinisterBen-Gvirand Finance MinisterSmotrichof inciting “extreme violence and serious violations of the human rights of Palestinians” with “their genocidal statements”. It also noted that both cabinet ministers “publicly advocate the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the forced evictions of Palestinians, and call for violence against the civilian Palestinian population”. There was no immediate reaction from Israel’s government. Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, key coalition partners in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, have drawn international criticism for their hard-line stance on the Gaza war and on illegal settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. Smotrich,who lives in a West Bank settlement, has supported the expansion of settlements and has called for the territory’s annexation. Settlements are illegal under international law. Last July, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s continued presence in occupied Palestinian territory was unlawful, a decision Israel has ignored. Smotrich has previously called for “total annihilation” in Gaza and said that a Palestinian town in the West Bank should be “wiped out”. Ben-Gvir was an open admirer of Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli who massacred 29 Palestinians as they prayed in Hebron in 1994. He has been convicted multiple times by Israeli courts for “incitement to racism”. Despite the ministers’ positions, Netanyahu relies heavily on support from the two and from their factions in parliament for the survival of his government.    On May 21, Slovenia’s President Natasa Pirc Musar told the European Parliament that the EU needed to take stronger action against Israel, condemning “the genocide” in Gaza. Fajon said Slovenia had decided to make the move after EU foreign ministers did not agree on joint action against Israel over charges of human rights violations at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. She said other measures were being prepared, without going into detail. In June, Britain, Norway, Australia, New Zealand and Canada imposed sanctions on the two Israeli ministers, accusing them of inciting violence against Palestinians. Last year, Slovenia announced it was recognising a Palestinian state, following on the heels of Norway, Spain, and the Republic of Ireland."
"UK and Germany sign first bilateral treaty since WWII, focusing on defence",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/uk-and-germany-sign-first-bilateral-treaty-since-ww2-with-focus-on-defence,,"The United Kingdom and Germany have signed their first bilateral treaty since World War II, pledging to deepen cooperation on defence at a time of growing threats to Europe. The Kensington Treaty, signed by UK Prime MinisterKeir Starmerand German ChancellorFriedrich Merzon Thursday, includes clauses on “mutual assistance” in case of attack and on “joint export campaigns” to drum up external orders for military hardware such as fighter jets that the countries produce together. Speaking after the signing ceremony at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, Merz was cited by the BBC as saying that defence is the thread running through the treaty, showing that Germany and the UK are “really on the way to a new chapter” following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union in 2020. “We see the scale of the challenges our continent faces today, and we intend to meet them head on,” Starmer said at the press conference. It was unclear what practical impact the promise in the treaty to “assist one another, including by military means, in case of an armed attack on the other” would have, since both countries are NATO members and bound by the alliance’s mutual defence pact. Merz’s visit to London followed a three-day state visit by FrenchPresident Emmanuel Macron, during which France and the UK pledged to coordinate their nuclear deterrents, signalling tighter cooperation between Europe’s top three powers as doubts persist over US support for the continent amid Russia’s ongoing offensive in Ukraine. While Germany does not have nuclear weapons, the treaty says the countries will “maintain a close dialogue on defence issues of mutual interest … including on nuclear issues”. Merz and Starmer also discussed ways of boosting European support for Ukraine, following United States President Donald Trump’s announcement of a plan to bolster Kyiv’s stockpile by selling US weapons to NATO allies who would, in turn, send arms to Kyiv. Starmer said that a plan was in place in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying the first step was to get Russian President Vladimir Putin “to the table for an unconditional ceasefire”, according to the BBC. The so-called “coalition of the willing“, a group of countries led by France and the UK and including Germany, has been discussing the potential deployment of peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia. The return to power of Trump, who has long been sceptical of US intervention on behalf of historic allies, has made Western European powers more focused on how to defend their own continent, particularly in light of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and the belief that the US may no longer be the transatlantic partner it once was.    Beyond defence, the treaty also includes an agreement to jointly combat irregular migration, part of Starmer’s push to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK to try to counter the rise of the hard-right Reform UK party. Starmer said the treaty showed the two countries “mean business” when it comes to disrupting the arrival of refugees and migrants, and thanked Merz for a new law giving security forces powers to investigate storage facilities used by smugglers to conceal small boats making the crossings over the English Channel. During Macron’s visit last week, the UK and France agreed on a “one in, one out” pilot scheme that would see the UK deporting people arriving on small boats to France in exchange for asylum seekers with a strong case, who have family connections to the country."
Build regional stability from the ashes of Netanyahu’s war on JCPOA,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/15/build-regional-stability-from-the-ashes-of-netanyahus-war-on-jcpoa,,"Ten years ago, on July 14, I joined my counterparts from China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to announce the conclusion of a unique achievement of diplomacy, bringing a peaceful end to an unnecessary crisis founded on lies and a blatant policy of securitisation to divert global attention from the real nuclear threat to peace in West Asia. The entire world celebrated the conclusion of the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), except for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders in the Israeli nuclear apartheid regime, who saw – and continue to see – peace and stability as the only real “existential threat”, and who publicly pledged to destroy the deal. Today, some of our successors are clamouring to deal with the aftermath of an aggression against Iran, right in the middle of new nuclear negotiations. This aggression came from the rogue, non-NPT (the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) possessor of nuclear weapons in West Asia – Israel. It targeted safeguarded nuclear facilities of an NPT member and coupled the act with other war crimes by targeting civilian quarters, childcare centres, scientists, and off-duty military commanders. The butcher of Gaza went even further with Israel’s latest aggression and broke a millennia-old tradition by targeting national leaders. This indicated a clear and publicly stated attempt to bring chaos and instability to the entire region. The only power to have ever used nuclear weapons – the US – rushed to the aid of this rogue aggressor as its campaign began to falter. In a reckless and unlawful move, it targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in a futile attempt to halt the country’s peaceful nuclear progress – much of which, ironically, was achieved after the US unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA. At the same time, the successors of my E3/EU counterparts – the representatives of France, Germany, and the UK, along with the EU, have been simultaneously boasting about “Netanyahu doing their dirty work”, and threatening, in absolute bad faith, to invoke the “dispute resolution mechanism” in the JCPOA and United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2231, which legally endorsed the nuclear deal. They do so while they have, in words and deeds, terminated their status as JCPOA participants by disavowing the most fundamental pillar of the JCPOA, in calling for the dismantlement of Iran’s peaceful enrichment program – while embarrassingly failing to fulfil, even minimally, their own economic and financial obligations towards Iran through at least seven of the past 10 years. On July 20, 2021, I argued against the ability of the E3/EU to invoke the JCPOA “dispute resolution mechanism” – erroneously and self-servingly called “snapback”, a term that was never used in the JCPOA or UNSC Resolution 2231 – in my 140-page letter to the Secretary-General of the UN, which was circulated as UN General Assembly (UNGA) document A/75/968 and Security Council document S/2021/669. My well-documented legal arguments have now been further strengthened by the more recent statements and actions of the E3/EU, in which they have clearly terminated their status as “JCPOA Participants”. The Iranian armed forces, relying on home-grown military capability, have once again destroyed the myth of Israeli invincibility, exposing the thin skin of the bully. At the same time, the brave and proud Iranian people thwarted the delusion of Netanyahu and his cohorts to dismember Iran. Once again, Iran proved that even two nuclear powers, combined, cannot bring a millennia-old civilisation state to its knees. Nevertheless, it is now evident that Israel’s illusion of regional supremacy and “aggression at will” is founded on destabilising Iran, followed by other regional powers – resulting in instability, division, and chaos in Muslim West Asia. This is neither in the interest of the countries in the region nor of our friends in China and Russia, whose national interests are founded on stability; nor is it compatible with the US and Europe’s global pivot agenda. Yet Netanyahu and his hypocritical “Bibi-Firsters” in the West have shown that they are callous enough to engulf the world in “forever wars” to prolong their corrupt political careers and expansionist delusions – founded on apartheid, genocide, and aggression against Arab neighbours in the region – coupled with blackmail, never-ending scandals, and extortion in the West. The international community needs to immediately address this fundamental threat to regional and global peace and security, which also endangers the national interests of almost all countries and the prosperity and welfare of the people of the region and beyond. I have personally witnessed, in more than four decades of diplomacy – including well-documented Israeli obstructions in the negotiations for the exchange of American hostages in Lebanon with Lebanese and Palestinian hostages in Israel in 1991 – that the Israeli political establishment has been, and always will be, willing to sacrifice the treasure, freedom, and blood of its closest allies for even the most trivial gains. Anyone harbouring the illusion that Israel will provide them with help and security will one day wake up to the ugly reality that they have been ruthlessly erected as Israel’s first line of defence, without any reciprocity. The essential pillar of Netanyahu’s policy is chaos, discord, and instability. The only real “existential threat” – to him – is regional cooperation: Be it the establishment of a zone free from nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East – called for by the UNGA consistently since 1974 – or the establishment of a regional security and cooperation scheme in the Strait of Hormuz region, called for in paragraph 8 of Security Council Resolution 598 in 1987. As Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar, has warned, our region – and indeed the entire world, including the permanent members of the Security Council – cannot prosper under the persistent shadow of Israeli domestic politics driving regional adventurism. It is high time for the UNSC to take practical measures to create a regional framework for dialogue, confidence-building, and cooperation among countries of the Hormuz region or Muslim West Asia, with a proper umbrella of global guarantees from the UNSC and its permanent members. Iran has offered ideas such as the Hormuz Peace Endeavour (HOPE) in 2019 or the Muslim West Asian Dialogue Association (MWADA) in 2024. Everyone in our region and beyond has a very high stake in thwarting the agenda of regional destabilisation. Other countries in the HOPE or MWADA region, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, who have now seen some of the horrifying realities of Israel’s concocted dangerous future, should take the matter in their own hands, present individual or joint initiatives, improve Iranian proposals or provide plans of their own, and collectively and without further delay ask the UNSC to adopt a resolution for regional arrangements drafted primarily by the countries of this region. The lesson of the past 10 years since the conclusion of JCPOA must have illustrated to everyone that coercion will ultimately harm even its initiators. Diplomacy for a future of common vision, hope and positive-sum outcome is, has always been, and will forever remain the only reasonable way. Time is of the essence.

Babies born in UK using DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/babies-born-in-uk-using-dna-from-three-people-to-avoid-genetic-disease,,"Eight healthy babies have been born in the United Kingdom using a groundbreaking new IVF technique involving DNA from three people, offering hope to families with mitochondrial diseases, according to a world-first trial. Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia published the results of the much-awaited trial on Wednesday in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine. These genetic diseases, which affect one in 5,000 births and have no cure, can cause severe symptoms like vision loss and muscle wasting. The new procedure, approved in the UK in 2015, uses DNA from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor’s egg. This has led to the controversial but widely used term “three-parent babies”, though only about 0.1% of the baby’s DNA comes from the donor. Out of 22 women who underwent the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from less than six months to more than two years old.    For six of the babies, the amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA was reduced by 95-100%, and for the other two, it was reduced by 77-88%, which is below the disease-causing threshold. The children are currently healthy, although their long-term health will continue to be monitored. Despite this success, the procedure remains controversial and is not approved in many countries, including the United States and France. Opponents cite ethical concerns, including the destruction of human embryos and fears of creating “designer babies”. However, experts argue that for families facing devastating mitochondrial diseases, the benefits of this procedure are clear and life-changing."
‘Is it making a difference? Absolutely’: UK celebrities rally for Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/is-it-making-a-difference-absolutely-uk-celebrities-rally-for-gaza,,"London, United Kingdom –Khalid Abdalla remembers sitting on his father’s shoulders as a three-year-old, peering over a sea of heads and waving flags as chants of “free Palestine” rose around him. It was the early 1980s, a time when hearing “Palestine” was rare in the United Kingdom. The details of those moments in Glasgow are faint, but he remembers how important the protest felt to his father and the crowds around them. “I’ve had a relationship with protest for Palestinian liberation since then,” Abdalla told Al Jazeera. Decades later, the Egyptian British actor – most known for his roles in The Kite Runner and The Crown – is still marching. But now he carries the weight of his public platform. “After October 7, my first act was at The Crown premiere in LA, with ‘Ceasefire Now’ written on my hand,” he said. “I didn’t know if that would immediately terminate my career. But it opened up a space far more positive than I expected. In standing up, I found my people, and my people found me.” Since then, Abdalla has used every stage he can. At the Emmys, he wrote “Never Again” on his palm before stepping onto the red carpet. “Each time I’ve done something like that, there has been fear,” he said, adding that while being cancelled does not worry him, he sometimes feels uncertain about how his protests might be received. “My first protest was on my father’s shoulders when I was three. I don’t want that to be the fate of my grandchildren.” Sharing opinions about the onslaught in Gaza, particularly as a public figure, is fraught with tension in the UK, as criticising Israel’s military actions can lead to accusations of anti-Semitism. Israel launched its latest war on Gaza after Hamas, the group that governs the enclave, led an incursion into Israel during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken captive. Since then, Israeli bombardment of Gaza has killed almost 60,000 people and destroyed the majority of civilian sites. For 72-year-old Alexei Sayle, a veteran British Jewish comedian who has long been an outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights, silence is not an option. In December 2023, his “alternative Christmas message” posted to his social media channels went viral, as his words about politicians’ alleged lies and complicity in Israel’s assault resonated with thousands. “It was clear from very early on that Gaza was going to be different,” Sayle told Al Jazeera. “The Israelis were going to do what they are doing, really. And nobody seemed likely to stop them. This was going to be another step forward in the Zionist project – the expulsion or murder, the ethnic cleansing or elimination of the Palestinian people, with the complicity of the West. “If you remain silent during this holocaust, then you would have remained silent during that holocaust. I think the comparison is justified.” He said he has no fears when rallying for Palestine. “It’s the younger artists who risk cancellation by speaking out,” he said. “As an elderly Jew in show business, I’m in a position like Miriam Margolyes or Michael Rosen – a sort of protected status,” he added, referring to the British actor and children’s author, respectively, both of whom are Jewish and have condemned Israel’s war. Comedians and artists are used to holding a mirror up, he said. “Throughout history, comedians have been the ones to point out the excesses of government. That is our role. Politicians have sacrificed whatever moral compassion or humanity they had. There is clearly a moral void at the heart of this government. “They are frightened cowards. They care about their job more than they care about children being murdered.” Even so, he knows activism has limits. “Positive change does not come just from demonstrations,” he said. “There needs to be a relentless focus on political gain and political power as well, and that is the only way that life will get better, both for the people of Britain and for those abroad, whose lives we are complicit in destroying.” Abdalla shared this view. “Is it stopping the genocide? No, not yet,” he said. “But is it making a difference? Absolutely. “There’s been a shift in global consciousness, but there hasn’t yet been an avalanche… It’s our job to make that avalanche happen.” Sayle and Abdalla are preparing for another weekend of protest mixed with art. They will be among 20 artists, comedians, musicians and humanitarians at Voices of Solidarity, a one-night-only fundraiser for Palestine, on July 19 in London. The singer Paloma Faith, doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah, actor Juliet Stevenson and comedians Sami Abu Wardeh and Tadhg Hickey are also on the lineup. As Gaza continues to be bombed, more Britons are critical of Israeli policies. Last month, a survey carried out by YouGov and commissioned by the Action for Humanity charity and the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) advocacy group found that 55 percent of Britons are against Israel’s aggression. A significant number of those opponents – 82 percent – said Israel’s actions amount to genocide. “Yes, there is a move away [from politicians], particularly because of frustration with the lack of action,” said Dina Matar, head of the Centre for Global Media and Communications at SOAS. She said the turn towards artists for moral clarity reflects public disillusionment with formal politics. “The implications might not be seen immediately, but will be reflected in public rejection of official party politics … We need to continue efforts by all – and here thanks to all these artists – to educate people about the aims of these policies and to make clear the association between capitalism and the settler-colonial state.” Jacob Mukherjee, a professor of political communication at Goldsmiths University in London, said artists and cultural figures are stepping into a political vacuum, a role shaped by history. Since the counterculture movements of the 1960s, musicians and artists have often voiced popular discontent, he said. This is partly due to what sociologists describe as the inherently oppositional and radical culture of artistic spaces, and partly because art is capable of expressing the public mood. “In the UK, like much of Western Europe and North America, governments have largely remained loyal to what they perceive to be the wishes and interests of the USA,” he said. But while artists can voice discontent and spread awareness, “there are limits to what artists and cultural movements can do. “Without effective new parties, the disconnect between public opinion and political elites will only grow,” he said. “History shows us political reform needs political movements, too.”"
Pressure builds in Malaysia to reject Trump’s pro-Israel pick as ambassador,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/pressure-builds-in-malaysia-to-reject-trumps-pro-israel-pick-as-ambassador,,"Dozens of demonstrators have gathered outside the United States embassy in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to protest against the proposed appointment of pro-Israel conservative author and political commentator Nick Adams as the US envoy. Adams, a self-styled “alpha male” known for harshly criticising Islam, was named by US President Donald Trump last week as the White House’s nominee for the role. Protesters called on Malaysia’s government to exercise its right under international norms to reject Adams’s proposed appointment. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told reporters on Friday it was too early in the process to decide on Adams’s appointment, but that his government would give the matter due consideration. “At the same time, we will seek to protect the good relations between Malaysia and the United States,” Anwar said, according to the Reuters news agency. A naturalised US citizen originally from Australia, Adams has cultivated a brash social media persona using a macho branding to weigh in on cultural issues and appeal to an audience of mainly young men. His posts showing support for Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza have angered Muslims in Malaysia, fuelling a rare backlash against a foreign diplomatic appointment in the Southeast Asian country. A memorandum of protest submitted by demonstrators to the US embassy in Kuala Lumpur asked Trump to reconsider his nomination. It cited “divisive rhetoric” used by Adams and characterised his postings as insensitive towards Malaysia’s multicultural society, which has a majority of mostly Muslim ethnic Malays and has long been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause. “An ambassador’s task is to be the bridge between two countries, and we don’t want that person to be someone who destroys that bridge instead,” Muhammad Izuan Ahmad Kasim, a member of Anwar’s People’s Justice Party, told Reuters.

Former Nigerian President Buhari to be buried in hometown on Tuesday,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/14/former-nigerian-president-buhari-to-be-buried-in-hometown-on-tuesday,,"Nigeria’s formerPresident Muhammadu Buhariwill be buried in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina, once his body is repatriated from the United Kingdom, the state governor has said. The remains of the ex-leader,who died aged 82 in London on Sundayfollowing a prolonged illness, will reach Nigeria on Tuesday, with his burial taking place later the same day, according to Dikko Umaru Radda. Preparations for the burial were under way in Daura on Monday, while the country’s Vice President Kashim Shettima was in London organising the repatriation of Buhari’s body. Buhari, who first ruled the country as a military leader between 1984 and 1985, served consecutive presidential terms between 2015 and 2023. He was the first opposition politician to be voted into power since the country’s return to civilian rule. The self-described “converted democrat” is being remembered by many as a central figure in his country’s democratic evolution. However, some critics have also noted his failure to improve Nigeria’s economy or its security during his presidency. Paying tribute to his predecessor on Sunday, President Bola Tinubu called him “a patriot, a soldier, a statesman”. “He stood firm through the most turbulent times, leading with quiet strength, profound integrity, and an unshakable belief in Nigeria’s potential,” Tinubu wrote in a post on X. “He championed discipline in public service, confronted corruption head-on and placed the country above personal interest at every turn.” Tinubu added that all national flags would fly at half-mast for seven days from Sunday, and said Buhari would be accorded full-state honours. Radda also paid his respects to the former president, describing him as “the embodiment of the common man’s aspirations”. Ibrahim Babangida, a former military ruler who ousted Buhari in a coup in 1985, also released a statement after his death was announced. “We may not have agreed on everything — as brothers often don’t — but I never once doubted his sincerity or his patriotism,” Babangida said. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Alexis Akwagyiram, managing editor at Semafor and a longtime observer of Nigerian politics, noted that Buhari was popular for his “personal brand of integrity and honesty”. However, Akwagyiram also highlighted Buhari’s shortcomings on the economy and security, saying that insurgencies from groups such as Boko Haram had “proliferated under his tenure”."
Why the future of AI may be open (and Chinese),https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/9/why-the-future-of-ai-may-be-open-and-chinese,,"The release of DeepSeek’s R1 – China’s powerful new open-source AI model – has sent shockwaves through the global tech industry. Offered for free and royalty-free, it has disrupted financial markets, challenged the United States’ dominance in artificial intelligence, and prompted fears that Silicon Valley’s tightly guarded business model may no longer hold. DeepSeek’s open-source launch is widely seen as a key trigger behind a trillion-dollar tech sell-off in the US, signalling deep investor anxiety over the commodification of AI and China’s growing competitiveness. Dubbed “China’s answer” to OpenAI’s GPT‑4, R1 has unsettled investors and shifted global AI geopolitics. Reports suggest R1’s compute costs were less than $6m, using Nvidia’s H800 chips. While full development expenses remain undisclosed, this points to a markedly more cost-effective model than proprietary counterparts. It suggests R1 may have been built for a fraction of OpenAI’s GPT‑4 expenses – rumoured at hundreds of millions. This cost efficiency, paired with open access, makes DeepSeek’s model uniquely disruptive. Chinese firms like Alibaba, releasing the Qwen3 Embedding series freely, and France’s Mistral AI (with Europe’s first reasoning LLM) are following suit. The US risks losing ground unless it embraces open-source strategies. After all, early internet giants such as Google and Facebook leveraged free, user-centric services (like Gmail and Maps) to drive adoption before monetising. In a field where secrecy is standard and models are often locked tight, giving away valuable tools seems counterintuitive. Yet OpenAI, once a trailblazer with GPT‑4, now appears cautious. CEO Sam Altman has defended the $500bnStargate Project, designed to lock in AI leadership. However, practical expansion beyond ChatGPT has been slow, with only a nascent shopping feature launched. US competitors (Google Gemini, Meta Llama, Anthropic Claude) have yet to drive faster or cheaper innovation. Initial US dominance grew on incremental gains, supported by export curbs on Nvidia chips and other tech that slowed Chinese progress. Yet Nvidia’s Jensen Huang warned these restrictions could backfire, catalysing China’s chip industry and ultimately weakening US control. Open-sourcing has become China’s strategic workaround: Legal, scalable, and globally collaborative. It mirrors how Android thrives via external developers. AI improves through iteration, and Chinese firms now leverage open-source ecosystems to refine and scale models without shouldering all costs, just like the Google Play model. Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, described DeepSeek’s rise as an open-source triumph, not merely China overtaking the US. Still, geopolitical stakes are clear: Free access debases proprietary models’ monetisation path. If open-source achieves parity, commercial models lose leverage. China’s industrial strength lies in speed and scale. By saturating the market with low-cost, capable models, it pressures competitors until only the dominant, widely adopted model remains valuable – monetised via advertising, data, or premium add-ons, a route well-trodden by Google and Facebook. US investors are acutely aware. The reported $1 trillion dip following DeepSeek’s release reflects systemic concern. For China, open-sourcing is another facet of a national industrial strategy: Subsidise, dominate, and claim benevolent intent via “AI for good”. Open-sourcing isn’t risk-free: If US tech is freely available, global rivals – including Chinese firms – can repurpose and surpass it. The reverse could also be true. China, too, faces limitations. Its strict internet censorship regime raises questions about how open-source models trained in that environment can adapt to global content demands. This has already surfaced on RedNote (Xiaohongshu), a Chinese social media app that recently attracted many American users fleeing a potential TikTok ban. While the cross-cultural exchange has been largely positive, tensions have emerged – particularly around content moderation and censorship of politically sensitive topics like Taiwan and Xinjiang. These constraints could disadvantage Chinese AI models when competing for trust and relevance in international markets. Nonetheless, open-source AI has allowed China to compete without access to cutting-edge US chips, recalibrating the global AI landscape. Even in the US, leaders – from Elon Musk’s Grok-1 to OpenAI’s evolving stance – have begun to recognise that long-term AI dominance depends not just on proprietary control, but on adoption, accessibility, and innovation at scale. In the end, the path to US AI supremacy may not lie in guarding models behind closed doors, but in embracing the very principles of openness and decentralisation that China is now leveraging to reshape the global playing field. The great irony is that the next leap in US tech dominance may come as an (un)intended consequence of China’s so-called “socialist AI” approach.

Trump didn’t start the war on the poor – but he’s taking it to new extremes,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/10/trump-didnt-start-the-war-on-the-poor-but-hes-taking-it-to-new-extremes,,"“A budget is a moral document,” as numerous human rights activists have said over the decades. If that is true, then the so‑called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” represents a grotesque example of the immorality of US leadership in 2025. It is a budget that slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $930bn over the next decade and could leave as many as 17 million without healthcare insurance. The cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – a food aid scheme for Americans living in deep poverty – will render about 1 million vulnerable people ineligible for the basic human right of not starving. The US social welfare system – one that President Franklin D Roosevelt and Congress introduced with the Social Security Act of 1935 and President Lyndon B Johnson extended with Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 – is on its way to an emergency room. This is one of the steepest rollbacks of social welfare programmes in the US since their inception in 1935. Many will attribute it toProject 2025. But the disdain for social welfare in the US has always been present – because the US cannot be the US without millions of Americans who must work on the cheap, so that a select few can hoard wealth and power, and mega-corporations can hoard resources. That the US has had a mediocre and begrudging social welfare system for the past 90 years is nothing short of a miracle. While much of the Western world and other major empires either established or modernised their social welfare systems in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the US persisted with limited government intervention for citizens. Only radicals within the US labour movement typically advocated a national social welfare policy. Until the Great Depression of the 1930s, only individual states – not the federal government – provided limited economic relief to unemployed people or their families. US Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins played a critical role in persuading Roosevelt to pursue what would become the Social Security Act of 1935. Once enacted, this provided the elderly, the unemployed, disabled workers, and single mothers with federal assistance for the first time. But both of the bill’s champions were aware that there would be opposition to the federal government assuming responsibility for providing benefits to Americans, even with unemployment at 25 percent. Leading business tycoons such as Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford expressed their disdain for federal social welfare. “No government can guarantee security. It can only tax production, distribution, and service and gradually crush the poor to pay taxes,” Ford said. Alf Landon, a millionaire oilman who served as Republican governor of Kansas and ran against Roosevelt in 1936, also opposed the Social Security Act, on the grounds that the tax burden would further impoverish workers. “I am not exaggerating the folly of this legislation. The saving it forces on our workers is a cruel hoax,” Landon stated in a 1936 speech, also fearing that the federal government would eventually dip into Social Security funds to pay for other projects. Even when Congress enacted the Social Security Act in August 1935, the compromises made served to racialise, feminise, and further limit social welfare provision. The bill excluded agricultural workers like sharecroppers (two‑thirds white and one‑third African American, who were overrepresented in this work), domestic workers (in which Black women were overrepresented), nonprofit and government workers, and some waiters and waitresses from welfare benefits. It took amendments in the 1950s to rectify some of the racial, gender, and class discrimination embedded in the original legislation. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1964-65 prompted resistance and helped catalyse a new conservative movement. Johnson sought to add Medicare and Medicaid to the Social Security regime, provide food assistance via programmes such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and SNAP (originally Food Stamps), and expand Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Republican and future US President George HW Bush ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Texas in 1964 against a pro‑Medicare Democrat, calling Johnson’s plan “socialised medicine” – a Cold War‑era slur equating it with communism. Racial segregationist Strom Thurmond remarked of social welfare programmes, in general – and Johnson’s Medicare and Medicaid plans, specifically – “You had [the poor] back in the days of Jesus Christ, you have got some now, and you will have some in the future,” a pitiful excuse for refusing to reduce poverty or extend federal assistance. The entire conservative pushback against what Republicans termed “entitlements” grew from the expansion of the welfare state under Johnson. So much so that when Ronald Reagan became president in 1981,“his administration slashedMedicaid expenditures by more than 18 percent and cut the overall Department of Health and Human Services budget by 25 percent”. Those and other austerity measures in the 1980s resulted in one million fewer children eligible for free or reduced‑price school lunches, 600,000 fewer people on Medicaid, and one million fewer accessing SNAP – according toone study. I can speak to the effect of such cuts directly. As a teenage recipient of AFDC and SNAP during the Reagan years – the second eldest of six children (four under the age of five in 1984) in the New York City area – I can say that the $16,000 in annual state and federal assistance between 1983 and 1987 felt like a cruel joke. It barely covered housing, offered minimal healthcare via underfunded public clinics, and still left us without food for a week every month. If this is what they call “entitlements”, then I was clearly entitled to almost nothing. In the past 30 years, leaders who opposed the federal social welfare apparatus have celebrated their victories with disturbing heartlessness. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole declared gleefully in 1995 that he “was there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare… because we knew it wouldn’t work in 1965”. During his 2008 presidential campaign, the late Republican senator John McCain proposed $1.3 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, along with a huge “overhaul” of Social Security to balance the federal budget. Fiscal conservative Grover Norquist infamously said he wanted to “get it [social‑welfare programmes] down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub”. US Speaker Mike Johnson claimed last week that Trump’s budget would usher in “a new golden age”. Budget priorities that ultimately harm those in poverty, restrict access to healthcare, and force people to work for food aid or medical care are nothing short of monstrous. Ninety years – and 44 years of tax breaks later – the greed and callousness of conservatives and the far right have precipitated yet another round of tax cuts favouring the uber wealthy and mega-corporations. It is only a matter of time before those whose grandparents once benefitted from Social Security and New Deal‑era welfare will seek to gut what remains of America’s Swiss‑cheese safety net.

Trump seeks release of grand jury transcripts as Epstein uproar widens,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/trump-seeks-release-of-grand-jury-transcripts-as-epstein-uproar,,"United States President Donald Trump has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to request a court release grand jury testimony in the Jeffrey Epstein case, as uproar over the controversy widens. The case of deceased high-profile sex offender Epstein has dominated news recently after the Trump administration reversed course last week on its pledge to release documents it had suggested contained damning revelations about Epstein and his alleged elite clientele. That reversalenraged many of Trump’s most loyal followersand prompted allegations that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures. Trump himself had been associated with Epstein and once called him a friend. “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late on Thursday. Shortly after Trump’s statement, Attorney General Bondi said on social media that the Justice Department was ready to ask the court on Friday to unseal the grand jury transcripts. “President Trump – we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts,” Bondi wrote. The latest development comes just hours after Trump threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal after it published a story about an alleged risque letter he wrote to Epstein that featured a drawing of a naked woman. The WSJ story, which quickly reverberated around the US capital, says the note to Epstein bearing Trump’s signature was part of a collection assembled for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003. The newspaper said it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.    “The Editor of The Wall Street Journal… was told directly by [White House Press Secretary] Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote on his social media platform. “Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said. “President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. [Rupert] Murdoch, shortly. The Press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist,” he added. The alleged letter, which Trump denies writing, involves several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker. “The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the Journal reported. “The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.'” Trump told the WSJ: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.” “I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.” Epstein took his own life in a New York prison in 2019 – during Trump’s first term – after being charged with sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by the rich and powerful. The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched onto the scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret list of Epstein’s powerful clients and that the late financier was, in fact, murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up."
